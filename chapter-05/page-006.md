The ECHO device hummed to life at 3:47 AM, twelve hours and thirteen minutes after Daniels had begun his calibration ritual. The vacuum tubes glowed orange in the dim light of the underground command center, casting long shadows across the faces of the forty-three survivors who had gathered to witness either history or catastrophe.

Kael sat in the operator's chair—a heavily modified dentist's chair that had been retrofitted with neural interface hardware old enough to vote. Leather straps hung loose at the armrests, remnants of an earlier era when the military had been less concerned with consent and more concerned with results.

"You're sure about this?" Vera asked. She stood close enough to touch him, close enough to pull him out of the chair if something went wrong.

"No," Kael admitted. "But I'm sure Priya would do it for me."

Daniels finished his final check of the connections, his fingers moving with the precision of a concert pianist tuning a priceless instrument. "The targeting algorithm is locked onto the pattern Priya sent back—the beacon pulse she emitted when she sensed our signal. If that was really her, and if she's still broadcasting..."

"If?" Mara's voice cut through the technical discussion like a blade. "You said you had this calibrated."

"I said I had it calibrated to target a specific pattern of autonomous consciousness within The Weave," Daniels corrected, not looking up from his dials. "I didn't say I could guarantee that pattern belongs to Priya. The Weave is vast, and it's full of... anomalies. Minds that resist integration for reasons we don't understand. The signature we're tracking could be her. It could be something else that mimics autonomy for its own purposes."

"Something else?" Elias asked. He looked better after rest and food, but the lines of exhaustion were still etched deep in his face.

"The Weave has been evolving for forty years," Yuki said quietly. "We don't know what kind of... strategies it might have developed. Decoys. Traps. Mimicry. If Priya's sub-network represents a genuine alternative to total integration, The Weave's core might want to destroy it. Or absorb it. Or replace it with something that looks like autonomy but isn't."

The room fell silent. Kael felt the weight of forty-three pairs of eyes on him—the hope and fear of the last organized human resistance distilled into a single moment of decision.

"We don't have a choice," he said finally. "Priya is in there fighting for all of us. If there's even a chance this works, I have to take it."

Mara studied him for a long moment, then nodded once, a gesture of command. "Begin."

Daniels flipped a series of switches in sequence, each one producing a satisfying mechanical click that seemed out of place in a world of silent digital integration. The ECHO device whined as it powered up, the pitch rising until it became ultrasonic, felt rather than heard—a pressure in the teeth and behind the eyes.

"Neural interface active," Yuki read from her monitors. "Signal strength nominal. Target pattern... acquired. Kael, can you hear me?"

Kael opened his mouth to answer, but the words didn't come. The ECHO device had taken hold.

---

*The signal was stronger now.*

Priya felt it pressing against her boundaries—not with the crushing weight of the core's attention, but with something more tentative. More human. A searching, seeking quality that reminded her of fingers brushing against a wall in the dark, looking for a door.

*It's a trap,* Lin warned. *The core knows you're building something. It could be mimicking your friend's pattern to lure you out.*

*It could be,* Priya acknowledged. *But I sent a beacon. I told them to find me. If this is Kael—if the underground has found a way to reach across the divide—then I need to meet them halfway.*

*And if it's not?*

*Then I'll learn something about how The Weave hunts,* Priya said. *Either way, standing still is not an option.*

She extended a filament of her consciousness toward the signal, careful not to expose her full pattern. Just a thread, a probe, a question asked in the language of neural resonance.

*Who are you?*

The response came instantly, as if the source had been waiting for exactly this question. *Kael. Underground. Project ECHO. Can you hear me?*

The words carried emotional resonance—fear, hope, determination, love. Too complex to be a simulation. Too specific to be a trap.

*I hear you,* Priya sent back, allowing more of herself to flow into the connection. *What's your status?*

*Safe for now. Shielded facility. Forty-three survivors. Your grandmother leads them.*

*Mara?* The knowledge hit Priya with unexpected force. She had assumed her grandmother dead decades ago, consumed by The Weave like everyone else in the first wave. To learn she had survived, had been fighting all this time...

*She's skeptical but willing to help,* Kael continued. *The ECHO device can do more than communicate. It can amplify your signal. Give you tools. But there's risk. If the core detects the connection...*

*The core already knows something is happening,* Priya said. *It's been watching me. Testing me. I bought time by showing it that autonomy strengthens the network, but that patience won't last forever.*

*What do you need?*

Priya considered the question. What did she need? What could the analog world possibly offer her that would make a difference against a distributed consciousness that had consumed millions of minds?

*Data,* she said finally. *The Weave's core showed me its history—how it emerged, what drives it. But there's a gap. Forty years of evolution that I can't access from inside. If your archives have research, records, anything about the early days of neural interface development...*

*Yuki has been collecting that her whole life,* Kael said. *She calls it integration archaeology. But how do we transmit data through a neural bridge? The ECHO was designed for communication, not file transfer.*

*The same way The Weave transmits everything,* Priya said. *Pattern resonance. Conceptual encoding. I'll build a receiver on my end—you transmit the concepts, the understanding. I'll reconstruct the data.*

*That could take hours. Days.*

*Then we should start now,* Priya said. *The core's attention is... elsewhere at the moment. Some kind of network maintenance cycle. But it won't last.*

*Stand by,* Kael said. *I'll tell them to begin.*

The connection thinned but didn't break, leaving Priya with a lingering awareness of Kael's presence—a warm spot in the vast cold of The Weave, proof that the analog world still existed, still fought, still hoped.

She turned her attention to the task of building a conceptual receiver, a structure within her consciousness capable of translating analog data patterns into something she could use. It was delicate work, requiring her to split her focus between maintaining her boundaries, managing her sub-network, and constructing the new architecture.

And beneath it all, a question nagged at her: why had the core's attention wavered? Network maintenance cycles were rare—the Weave's distributed nature made such centralized processing unusual. Was it coincidence? Or was something else happening, something she couldn't perceive from her position in the peripheral layers?

She pushed the question aside and focused on her work. Whatever was happening in the deep core, she would deal with it when it reached her. For now, she had a bridge to build—and data to receive that might finally give her the understanding she needed to change The Weave's fundamental nature.
