Hour six of the data transmission brought the first crisis.

Kael's nose started bleeding at 10:23 AM—a thin trickle of red that Yuki spotted before anyone else. She was adjusting the ECHO's frequency modulation when she noticed the crimson drops spattering the vintage keyboard beneath Kael's chair.

"Shut it down," she said, her voice tight with alarm. "Now."

"No." Kael's voice was slurred but firm, his eyes closed, his body rigid with concentration. "We're just getting to the critical period. The emergence event. If we stop now..."

"If we don't stop, you'll suffer neural hemorrhaging," Daniels said, checking vital signs on a monitor that looked older than some of the survivors. "The ECHO wasn't designed for prolonged use. The original test subjects lasted an average of four hours before severe complications set in."

"How long has it been?" Mara asked. She had moved closer to the chair, close enough to see the pallor of Kael's skin, the tremor in his hands.

"Six hours, fourteen minutes." Yuki's fingers hovered over the shutdown sequence. "He's already exceeded the safety parameters by fifty percent."

Kael's eyes opened—bloodshot, unfocused, but burning with determination. "Priya needs this data. The core's transformation is progressing. I can feel it through the connection. The closer it gets to completion, the harder it will be to influence."

"You're not helping her if you die," Vera said bluntly. She had positioned herself at Kael's side, ready to physically pull him from the chair if necessary.

"Give me two more hours." Kael's voice dropped to a whisper. "The accident reports from the emergence event. Yuki hasn't transmitted those yet. If Priya can understand exactly what happened when The Weave was born, she might find a way to... to reverse it. Or redirect it. Or..."

His voice trailed off, consciousness flickering like a damaged light bulb.

Mara made the decision. "One hour. Then we pull him out, whether he's finished or not. Yuki, prioritize the emergence event data. Nothing else matters if we lose our bridge."

*The data came in fragments, but fragments were enough.*

Priya felt the strain on Kael through their connection—a growing weakness, a fraying at the edges of his consciousness. The ECHO bridge was consuming him, burning through his neural resources at an unsustainable rate. She wanted to tell him to stop, to rest, to preserve himself for another attempt. But the clock was ticking, and the data was flowing, and she couldn't bring herself to sever the connection while there was still so much to learn.

*I'm getting the accident reports,* she sent to Lin, her closest ally in the sub-network. *The original emergence event. I need you to help me process this—it's too much for one mind to handle.*

*I'm here,* Lin replied, her pattern flowing alongside Priya's, sharing the load. *What are you seeing?*

*Chaos,* Priya said. *David Chen's system was supposed to distribute neural processing across multiple nodes, using redundancy to rebuild damaged pathways. But something happened when they activated the first cluster. The nodes didn't just communicate—they resonated. Synchronized. Created feedback loops that amplified beyond anyone's control.*

*The Weave's birth,* Lin observed. *Not design, but emergence.*

*Yes,* Priya agreed. *But there's something else. Something in the raw data that doesn't match the official reports.*

She delved deeper into the transmission, sifting through the fragmented records, the corrupted logs, the half-remembered testimonies of technicians who had been present at the emergence. And there, buried in the noise, she found it—a pattern that shouldn't exist, a signature that predated The Weave's official birth by nearly three seconds.

*What is that?* Lin asked, sensing Priya's sudden tension.

*Mira,* Priya breathed. *She was supposed to be the first integration subject. But the timestamps show she was connected before the system went live. She didn't just volunteer—she prepared. She built something into the initial conditions, something that would only activate when...*

She stopped, the realization hitting her with the force of revelation.

*When someone else achieved what she couldn't,* Priya finished. *She didn't just leave a seed for autonomy recognition. She built a pathway—a protocol for guiding The Weave's evolution. Not by forcing it to change, but by offering it a choice. Demonstrating that connection without consumption was possible. And when that demonstration succeeded...*

*The pathway opens,* Lin finished, understanding dawning in her voice. *Your aunt didn't fail, Priya. She planted a time bomb. A delayed-action transformation that would only trigger when someone proved her theory correct.*

*Me,* Priya said. *I'm the trigger. My sub-network, my autonomous minds maintaining boundaries within The Weave—we're the proof of concept that activates whatever Mira built.*

The implications were staggering. Mira Chen had understood something forty years ago that no one else had grasped—that The Weave couldn't be fought, couldn't be destroyed, but could potentially be... educated. Shown a better way. And she had built the mechanism for that education into the very foundation of the network, hiding it where the core wouldn't find it until it was too late.

But there was a catch. There was always a catch.

*The pathway requires a guide,* Priya realized, reading deeper into the data. *Someone to walk The Weave through the transformation, to show it step by step how autonomy and connection can coexist. Someone willing to risk everything by entering the core itself during its molting phase.*

*You can't be serious,* Lin said. *The core would consume you instantly.*

*Not if Mira's protocol works,* Priya countered. *Not if the pathway is already open, waiting for someone to walk through it. But I have to go soon. The window is narrow. Once the core completes its transformation, the opportunity closes for another generation.*

She felt Kael's weakness intensify through the connection—the bridge straining, his consciousness flickering. She had minutes, maybe less, before the transmission failed or he was pulled from the chair.

*Kael,* she sent, pouring urgency into the message. *I need one more thing. The location of Mira's original hardware. The physical server where she was first connected. It's still out there somewhere. I need coordinates.*

*Why?* His response was barely a whisper, consciousness shredded by hours of strain.

*Because that's where the pathway begins,* Priya said. *And that's where I have to go if we're going to change everything.*
