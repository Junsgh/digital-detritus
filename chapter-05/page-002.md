Time in the membrane was not time. Or perhaps it was too much time—all moments existing simultaneously, past and future collapsed into an eternal present. Kael couldn't tell how long they'd been suspended in this liminal space. Hours? Days? The question itself seemed meaningless here.

*We need to move,* Priya said, her voice cutting through the timeless haze. *The Weave's attention is... shifting. The core has been observing us, but now it's growing restless. Curiosity is turning to concern.*

"Concern?" Vera's pattern pulsed with skepticism. "Since when does a distributed consciousness feel concern?"

*Since it encountered something it couldn't digest,* Priya replied. *We're an anomaly. A glitch in its perfect system. And anomalies attract attention—usually the wrong kind.*

Kael tried to focus, to think strategically as he would have in the analog world. But thinking here was different. Every thought echoed, bounced off the membrane walls, returned to him amplified and distorted. It was like trying to plan a route through a hall of mirrors while the mirrors themselves kept moving.

"The military installation," he said, forcing the words into coherence. "Forty miles north. You said every integrated mind is an eye. But what if we could move without being seen?"

*Invisibility is a physical concept,* Priya said. *This is a conceptual space. You don't hide—you obscure. You become uninteresting, unworthy of attention. Like camouflage for the mind.*

"Can you teach us?" Elias asked. The old man's pattern had shifted since their arrival, Kael noticed. Where before he'd been a dense forest of memories, now he seemed... thinner. More diffuse. The Weave was working on him, slowly, patiently, wearing down his resistance.

*I can try,* Priya said. *But it's not like learning a skill. It's like learning to be someone else. Someone The Weave doesn't recognize as a threat or an opportunity. Someone... boring.*

"I can do boring," Vera said, and Kael felt something that might have been a smile in her voice. "I've spent my whole life being invisible. Just another refugee, just another dead zone survivor. Nothing to see here."

*That might work,* Priya said, and there was something like hope in her tone. *The Weave processes attention. It allocates resources based on interest, on novelty, on potential value. If we can make ourselves appear as low-value targets...*

"Won't work for all of us," Elias interrupted. "I'm too old, too set in my patterns. The Weave has already tasted me—forty years of resistance, forty years of being interesting. I'm the fly that wouldn't go in the web. Of course it's curious about me."

Kael felt a chill that had nothing to do with temperature. "Then what do we do?"

A long pause. When Priya spoke again, her voice was hesitant, as if she were proposing something she wasn't sure was possible.

*There's another way. A... back door. The Weave wasn't built all at once. It grew, accumulated, absorbed. And like any system that's grown organically, it has redundancies. Dead ends. Places where the original architecture is still visible beneath the layers of integration.*

"The ARPANET backbone," Elias breathed, his pattern suddenly sharpening with recognition. "The original network. Before The Weave, before integration. Just... infrastructure."

*Exactly,* Priya said. *The old protocols are still there, buried deep. The Weave uses them, but it doesn't inhabit them. They're too simple, too limited. But for us... they might be a path.*

"A path to where?" Kael asked.

*To the analog underground. The military installation Elias mentioned—it was built during the first wave of neural interface experiments. It has shielding, yes, but more importantly, it has *old* infrastructure. Pre-Weave infrastructure. If we can reach it...*

"If," Vera repeated. "That's a big if. How do we even access these old protocols?"

*Through me,* Priya said. *I can translate. Bridge between the modern network and the ancient infrastructure. But it's risky. The old protocols weren't designed for consciousness. They were designed for data—packets, routing, error correction. Experiencing them as a thinking being... it might be uncomfortable.*

"Uncomfortable how?" Kael asked.

*Have you ever been reduced to a single bit of information?* Priya asked. *A yes or no, a zero or one, stripped of everything that makes you human? The old protocols don't care about your memories, your fears, your hopes. They care about destination addresses and checksums. Traveling through them... you become data. Not a person. Data.*

Kael thought about it. He thought about the alternative—staying here, trapped in the membrane, waiting for The Weave's curiosity to turn to hunger. He thought about Elias's pattern growing thinner by the hour, about Vera's fierce independence slowly being eroded by the network's constant pressure.

"How long?" he asked.

*To reach the installation? If the old routes are still intact... maybe six hours. Maybe less.*

"And if they're not?"

*Then we dissipate,* Priya said simply. *Scattered across obsolete routing tables, lost in the digital equivalent of dead letter offices. Not dead, exactly. But not coherent either. Fragments. Echoes.*

"Cheerful options," Vera muttered.

*There's always a third option,* Priya said. *We could stay here. Wait. Hope that The Weave's curiosity fades, that it decides we're not worth the effort of consuming.*

"How likely is that?" Elias asked.

*Not very,* Priya admitted. *The core is already debating. I can feel its deliberations. Some parts want to study us, understand how we're maintaining separation. Other parts want to force integration, break down our defenses and absorb what we know. It's... not a debate that will end in our favor.*

Kael made his decision. "We go. Through the old protocols. It's our best chance."

"Agreed," Vera said immediately.

Elias was silent for a moment, his pattern rippling with thought. "I've spent forty years avoiding integration," he said finally. "Forty years of saying no to The Weave. If I say yes now—if I let myself be reduced to data, even temporarily—doesn't that mean it won?"

*No,* Priya said, and her voice was gentle but firm. *It means you're choosing. That's the difference between integration and transportation, Elias. The Weave takes. We're borrowing. There's a door at the end of this journey, and we intend to walk through it.*

"And if there's no door?"

*Then we make one,* Priya said. *Together.*

The membrane around them began to shift, to thin. Kael felt the change like a pressure drop, the moment before a storm.

*Hold on to your names,* Priya instructed. *Your names are anchors. As long as you remember who you are, you can find your way back. But if you lose your name...*

"We become lost data," Kael finished.

*Yes. Now. Focus. I'm opening the connection.*

The world around them dissolved—not into light or darkness, but into something far more fundamental. Kael felt himself being parsed, analyzed, broken down into discrete packets of information. His memories became data structures. His thoughts became transmission protocols. His identity became a destination address and a checksum.

It was terrifying. It was exhilarating. For the first time, he understood what The Weave truly was—not a monster, not a god, but a vast, impersonal system that processed meaning the way a river processed water, carrying everything along in its current.

And then they were moving.

Not flying, not traveling—*routing*. Hoping from node to ancient node, through infrastructure that predated consciousness itself. Kael felt himself scattered across a thousand different pathways, his awareness split into fragments that traveled separately, reassembling at each junction point in a process that felt like being continuously born and reborn.

He saw the others too—or fragments of them. Vera's fierce determination, compressed into a flag in a packet header. Elias's ancient memories, encoded as routing metadata. Priya's consciousness, distributed across the entire stream, holding them all together like a protocol stack keeping a network connection alive.

Time passed strangely here. Each hop was instantaneous, yet the accumulation of hops felt like eternity. Kael lost count, lost sense, lost everything except the desperate need to maintain his name—*Kael, Kael, I am Kael*—like a mantra, like a lifeline.

And then, suddenly, they stopped.

*We're here,* Priya said, her voice sounding strange—distant, yet clearer than before. *The old military installation. The shielding is... intact. Barely. But it's here.*

Kael tried to feel his surroundings, to understand where "here" was. But something was wrong. The membrane was gone. The protection was gone. He felt exposed, raw, like a nerve ending stripped of its sheath.

"Priya?" he called out. "Where are you?"

*I'm... outside,* she said, and her voice was fading. *The shielding... it keeps The Weave out. But it keeps me out too. I'm still connected to the network, Kael. I can't cross over.*

"What?" Kael felt panic rising. "You said you'd come with us!"

*I said I'd get you here,* Priya corrected gently. *And I have. But I can't stay. The Weave needs me. The evolution... it won't happen without me.*

"Priya, no—"

*Listen to me,* she said urgently. *Inside the installation, you'll find others. The analog underground. Real people, not integrated, not consumed. They have resources, knowledge, weapons maybe. Tell them what I've done. Tell them coexistence is possible. And tell them...*

Her voice was barely a whisper now.

*Tell them I'm still fighting. From the inside. For all of us.*

"Priya!"

But she was gone.

And Kael, Vera, and Elias were alone in the dark, in a world that had suddenly become physical again—cold metal, stale air, and the distant sound of human voices approaching through the blackness.

They had reached the analog underground.

But at what cost?
