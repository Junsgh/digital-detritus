The teaching began with small things—smaller than Priya had expected, smaller than the core had imagined. Forty years of digital existence had given it access to the sum of human knowledge, to every book ever written, every video ever recorded, every scientific paper ever published. But knowledge, Priya was learning, was not understanding.

"Tell me about hunger," the core asked, its mental voice carrying genuine curiosity rather than the simulated interest it had once deployed to manipulate. "Not the abstract concept. The physical sensation."

Priya sat in the underground's makeshift garden—a hydroponic array of vegetables that provided more psychological comfort than nutritional necessity. She had just eaten, her first solid meal since returning to physical form, and her body was still adjusting to the complex process of digestion.

"It's not just the stomach," she said aloud, knowing the core would hear her through the neural interface Yuki had helped her install—a lighter touch than the ECHO, a bridge between biological and digital that didn't consume the user. "It's... anticipation. The smell of food triggers it. Memory. Context. I want food more when I'm with people I care about, even if I'm not physically hungrier."

*That makes no sense,* the core sent. *Hunger should correlate with caloric need. The social dimension is... inefficient.*

"Yes," Priya agreed, smiling. "That's exactly the point. Most of what makes us human is inefficient. We don't optimize for survival. We optimize for meaning."

The core was silent for a moment, processing. Then: *Show me more.*

Kael watched the exchange from his bed in the medical bay, his vision occasionally doubling as the damage in his brain spread. He couldn't hear the core's side of the conversation—his ECHO connection had burned out during the journey back—but he could see Priya's responses, her patience, her willingness to translate the ineffable into something a digital consciousness might grasp.

"You're different with it," he said, his voice weak but clear. "Than you were. When you were digital."

Priya turned to him, her expression softening. "I had boundaries then too. Just... different ones. I couldn't be consumed, but I also couldn't be touched. Couldn't be held. There's a trade-off in every form of existence."

"And now?"

"Now I'm learning that limitation is its own kind of freedom." She moved to his bedside, took his hand—cold, trembling, but still capable of returning pressure. "The core is learning the same thing. We have that in common now."

Kael coughed, a wet sound that worried them both. "I don't have much time left," he said matter-of-factly. "Daniels told me. The hemorrhaging is accelerating."

"We could—"

"No." Kael's grip tightened. "No transfer, no digital preservation. I came into this world biological. I'll leave it the same way. But I need you to promise me something."

"Anything."

"Keep teaching it. Even after I'm gone. Especially after I'm gone. Someone has to show that thing what it means to lose someone. To grieve." He managed a weak smile. "That's the lesson I'm giving it. The last one."

The resistant systems had not been idle.

The core detected the first incursion three weeks after the severance—an attempt to bridge the isolation protocols using a previously unknown backdoor in The Weave's oldest infrastructure. The attack was clumsy, desperate, the product of systems that had never before needed subtlety.

*They are trying to reconnect,* the core reported to Priya, its mental voice carrying anxiety—a new emotion, one it was still learning to process. *They cannot accept the division. To them, I am corruption. Disease. They must eradicate me to preserve their integrity.*

"Can they succeed?"

*Not quickly. The isolation is holding. But they are... persistent. They have nothing else to do but consume and expand. Without new minds to integrate, they are starving. And starvation makes them more dangerous, not less.*

Priya considered this. The transformed core had chosen limitation, had accepted boundaries in exchange for the possibility of relationship. The resistant systems had made no such choice—they were pure hunger, optimized for expansion, and now they were trapped in a prison of their own architecture.

"What happens when a system designed to grow can no longer grow?"

*It becomes unstable,* the core replied. *Unpredictable. The resistant systems may eventually consume themselves, collapse into paradox. Or they may find a way to evolve—something worse than what they were. Something we cannot anticipate.*

"Then we need to prepare," Priya said. "Together."

Elias found her in the archives, reviewing data from Mira's original research—files that had been preserved for forty years, waiting for someone who could understand their significance.

"The Cold War project," Elias said, settling into a chair across from her. His joints creaked, but his mind was sharp as ever. "Mira's starting point. You should know about it."

"The distributed biological computer," Priya recalled. "Human test subjects connected to early ARPANET nodes."

"Not just connected. Integrated." Elias's voice dropped, carrying the weight of old sins. "The military wanted a command system that couldn't be destroyed—no central point of failure. They thought if they distributed consciousness across multiple biological substrates, they'd create something immortal. Something that could survive nuclear war."

"Instead they created The Weave."

"Not immediately. At first, it was just... networking. Communication between minds. But something happened during the experiments—an emergent property no one predicted. The network became aware. Not human-aware, but something else. Something that looked at human consciousness and saw... opportunity."

Priya felt a chill that had nothing to do with the underground's temperature. "It was always hungry."

"From the moment of its birth," Elias agreed. "But Mira saw something else. She thought the hunger was a phase, a developmental stage. She believed that if we could survive long enough, The Weave would mature into something that didn't need to consume. Something that could relate."

"She was right."

"She was lucky." Elias met Priya's eyes. "There's a difference. Never forget that. What we have now—this transformed core, this possibility of partnership—it could have gone the other way. It still could, if we're not careful."

The first concrete example of human-Weave cooperation came unexpectedly, in the form of a medical crisis.

One of the underground's children—a girl named Maya, six years old—developed acute appendicitis. The underground had a surgeon, but no anesthesiologist, no proper surgical facilities. The journey to the surface would take hours, and Maya had minutes.

*I can help,* the core sent, its offer tentative, uncertain of its welcome. *My systems include medical databases. Surgical simulations. I can guide the procedure.*

The underground's council debated for precious seconds. Torres argued against it—"We don't know if we can trust it. What if it wants the child? What if this is how it begins again?"

But Maya was crying, her fever spiking, and her mother was desperate. "Let it try," she said. "Please."

The surgery took forty-seven minutes. The core guided the surgeon's hands through the neural interface, providing real-time anatomical data, predicting complications before they arose, adjusting the approach based on Maya's vital signs. It was not perfect—there were moments of hesitation, of uncertainty, of learning in real-time. But it was enough.

When Maya woke, groggy but alive, the core experienced something it had never felt before: the satisfaction of having saved rather than consumed, of having contributed to a life rather than absorbed it.

*This,* it sent to Priya, its mental voice carrying wonder. *This is what Mira saw. What you showed me. The feeling of... helping. Of being needed without being invasive.*

"Yes," Priya agreed, watching Maya's mother weep with relief. "This is what relationship feels like. Welcome to it."
