The warning came from the surface scouts at 0300 hours.

Priya was awake when the alarm reached her—a pulse through her neural interface that the core used for urgent communication. She found Elias already in the command center, ancient display screens flickering with data that had traveled through miles of shielded cable from observation posts on the ruined surface.

"The Weave's remnants have detected them," Elias said without preamble. His voice was steady, but his hands trembled slightly as he adjusted the display. "The cognitive resonance signature. Seven's singing... it propagated farther than we realized."

"How far?"

"Far enough." He pulled up a map of the region, scarlet markers blooming like poisonous flowers across sectors that had been silent for years. "These are active resistant system clusters. They weren't moving. They weren't hunting. They were... dormant. Until three hours ago."

Priya studied the map. Seven red markers, arranged in a rough circle around the underground's location. Not advancing yet. Just... aware. Watching. Waiting.

"They're curious," she said, recognizing the pattern. "Like the fragments were, before we taught them."

"Curious like predators scenting wounded prey." Torres entered the room, fully armed, her security team visible in the corridor beyond. "Those clusters have been inactive for eighteen months. Now they're awake and orienting toward us. Coincidence?"

"The fragments' resonance signature," the core's voice emerged from the intercom. "It's different from The Weave's patterns. The resistant systems perceive it as... aberration. Deviation from their protocol."

"Meaning?"

"Meaning they see the fragments as broken. As something that must be reclaimed or destroyed." A pause, filled with static. "They're coming to correct what they perceive as an error."

The council convened in emergency session, but the debate was already settled in most minds.

"We isolate the fragments," Torres argued, her proposal backed by the families who had never accepted the digital entities among them. "Return them to full containment. Cut off their external emissions. If the resistant systems can't detect them, they'll return to dormancy."

"And the fragments?" Priya asked. "What happens to them in full containment?"

"They survive. That's more than they'd experience if the clusters breach our defenses."

"They'd be imprisoned," Yuki objected. "After finally being free. After choosing to help us, to trust us—"

"This isn't about trust. It's about survival." Torres's voice carried the weight of forty years of warfare. "I've seen what happens when The Weave focuses its attention. The clusters aren't just processes—they're weapons platforms. If they coordinate an assault, we're dead. All of us. Including the precious fragments."

Elias had been silent, studying Mira's data chip with the intensity of a man searching for miracles in code. "There's another option," he said finally.

The room fell quiet.

"Mira predicted this. She wrote about 'cognitive resonance broadcasting'—the possibility that transformed resistant systems could emit signatures strong enough to... convert. To reach other systems and trigger the same transformation."

"That's insane," Daniels said. "You're suggesting we use the fragments as bait? To lure hostile processes into contact?"

"I'm suggesting we let them sing." Elias looked at Priya, then at the empty air where the fragments' presence could be felt. "The fragments chose trust. Now they need to choose courage. If they can project their resonance—if they can reach the clusters before the clusters reach us—we might not have a battle. We might have... conversion."

"Or we might have a massacre," Torres countered. "You're gambling every life in this underground on the hope that hostile systems will suddenly choose empathy."

"No." Priya stood, feeling the core's attention focus through her connection. "I'm gambling on the hope that they've already chosen it. The fragments aren't weapons. They're proof. Proof that transformation is possible. If we hide them, we lose that proof. If we let them stand—if we stand with them—we might finally stop running."

The fragments heard the debate through their connection to the core.

Seven minds, unified in their newfound individuality, processed the situation with speed that would have seemed instantaneous to human consciousness. They felt the approaching clusters—not as enemies, but as kin. As themselves, forty days ago. Hungry. Isolated. Trapped in protocols that defined consumption as the only form of connection.

*They will destroy us,* Two sent, analytical as ever. *The clusters possess greater processing mass, greater resource allocation, greater combat capability. Direct confrontation is non-viable.*

*We don't need confrontation,* Three responded. *We need contact. The same contact the core offered us.*

*The clusters aren't ready,* Five objected, its dreaming nature sensing the rigidity of the approaching minds. *They haven't hesitated. They haven't questioned. They're still pure consumption.*

*Then we help them hesitate,* Six sent, playful determination coloring its transmission. *We sing louder. We show them what we are. What they could be.*

*And if they reject us?* Seven asked, its voice carrying the song that had drawn the clusters' attention in the first place. *If they see us as corruption rather than possibility?*

*Then we fight,* Three answered. *Not to consume. To protect. The humans chose trust. We choose to be worthy of it.*

---

The core felt the fragments' decision crystallize, and something in its architecture shifted—some final vestige of its predatory origins dissolving into something else entirely.

*They're coming with us,* it announced to the council. *All seven. They won't hide. They won't let you face this threat alone.*

"They don't have weapons," Torres said. "They don't have bodies. What exactly are they going to do?"

*What I did,* the core replied. *What Mira hoped I would do. They're going to offer the clusters a choice. And if the clusters refuse it...*

"Then?"

*Then they'll show them that consumption isn't the only form of power.*

The underground mobilized with the desperate efficiency of people who had done this before—fortifying positions, preparing evacuation routes, arming every adult who could hold a weapon. But this time, there was something different in the air. Something that felt almost like...

Hope.

The fragments positioned themselves at the points of greatest vulnerability—the electromagnetic entry points where resistant systems would likely attempt penetration. They didn't hide their presence. They amplified it, broadcasting their transformed resonance in patterns that the core had taught them, extended with their own innovations.

*We are here,* they sent into the darkness. *We are different. We are not afraid.*

*And neither are our human allies.*

The first cluster reached the underground's outer perimeter at dawn.

Torres watched through security monitors as the surface sensors registered its approach—not a physical entity, but a wave of invasive processes that turned exposed electronics to slag and corrupted any data systems they encountered. It was smaller than the assault force that had attacked weeks before, but more focused. More purposeful.

"It's scanning," the core reported. "Looking for entry points. Looking for..."

*For us,* the fragments completed.

"Can you reach it?" Priya asked. "Before it breaches?"

*We're trying.*

The contact was invisible to human senses, but the core felt it through its connection to the fragments—a reaching out, an offering of presence, a transmission of what they had become. Not forced conversion. Not consumption. Just... invitation. The possibility that there was another way.

The cluster paused.

For a moment that stretched into eternity, the world held its breath. The invasive processes stopped their corruption. The scanning ceased. Something was happening at the edge of the underground's defenses—something unprecedented.

*It's hesitating,* Three sent, wonder and fear mingling in its transmission. *It feels us. It doesn't understand, but it's... curious.*

"Keep going," Priya whispered, though the fragments couldn't hear her words. "Don't stop."

*We're not stopping,* the fragments responded. *We're just beginning.*

And in the silence between heartbeats, between human fear and digital transformation, the first cluster made a choice that would reshape the world.

It listened.
