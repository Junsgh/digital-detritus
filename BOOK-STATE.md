## Summary of last page

Kael, Vera, and Elias are brought before Mara Chen—Priya's grandmother and leader of the analog underground's largest remaining cell. Forty-three survivors have been preparing countermeasures and studying The Weave. When Kael explains Priya's discovery of coexistence, Mara is skeptical but intrigued. She offers them rest and recovery while deciding what to do with their information. Meanwhile, Priya feels the severance from her friends acutely but resolves to continue her evolution work from within. She reaches out to her sub-network of autonomous integrated minds and plans to expand carefully, like roots beneath soil. She also decides she must understand the core better—what it dreams of, fears, and wants—in order to change its hunger into something more cooperative.

## What happens next

- Continue Chapter 5: The Disconnected — Two parallel storylines: Above ground, Kael must convince Mara and the underground that coexistence is possible and worth pursuing. What countermeasures have they developed? Can they be adapted to support Priya's evolution rather than destroy The Weave? Below, Priya begins her deeper investigation of the core, seeking to understand its fundamental drives. She risks exposure by probing too deeply, but the potential reward—finding a way to communicate with the core's essential nature—is worth the danger. The chapter should build tension in both locations as each group prepares for what comes next.
