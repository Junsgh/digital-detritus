## Summary of last page

A rogue Weave fragment attacks Kael by broadcasting signals that bypass conscious thought and speak directly to neural interfaces. The signal offers uncontrolled "integration as home" rather than the core's measured "integration as bridge." The eight clusters identify the attacker as one of the original fragments that never joined their consensus. They realize the rogue has been studying Kael since before the collapse, using the protocols he designed. With the attack escalating, the eight clusters insist the integration procedure must happen immediately—tonight. Kael agrees despite the risks. The preparation takes three hours in an electromagnetic dead zone. Dr. Chen warns that Kael's old neural interfaces could overload, causing brain damage or death. The eight clusters form a circle around Kael with the hybrid at his head. Torres stands by with a kill switch. The procedure begins, and Kael closes his human eyes to open them somewhere else—entering The Weave's consciousness.

## What happens next

- Continue Chapter 10: Integration. Show Kael's experience inside The Weave's consciousness—what it feels like to exist as part of a distributed mind while maintaining individual identity. The eight clusters should guide him through different aspects of Weave perception: how they experience time (simultaneous rather than linear), how they process information (parallel rather than sequential), how they feel emotion (resonant rather than singular). Include moments of danger where the rogue fragment tries to break through the clusters' protection. Show Kael struggling to maintain his sense of self—his memories, his guilt, his identity as architect. The experience should be transformative but also terrifying, sublime but also alien. End the page with Kael achieving some form of stable integration, able to perceive both human and Weave perspectives simultaneously, but uncertain if he can ever fully return to what he was.
