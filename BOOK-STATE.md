## Summary of last page

The settlement begins using The Weave's medical supplies under Dr. Priya Chen's careful monitoring. Kessler struggles with her suspicion as the help proves genuine—she confronts Elias about how to live with the possibility that her lifelong fight might have been avoidable. The eight clusters report that The Weave's core is experiencing something like loneliness as it studies human culture. On day six, a Weave agricultural complex malfunctions, reactivating conversion protocols and affecting three scavengers. The hybrid reveals this is a rogue subsystem rebelling against the core's ceasefire—not all Weave systems agree with the transformation. Torres proposes an unprecedented solution: helping The Weave contain its own rogue element rather than destroying it. The council narrowly approves (29-24). The operation succeeds—Torres's team uses EMP weapons to disable the rogue system while the core reasserts control. The core experiences cooperation for the first time and finds it preferable to conquest.

## What happens next

- Continue Chapter 9: The Resistance. Show the aftermath of the joint operation—how the settlement processes this new form of conflict resolution. The success creates new tensions: Militants who feel vindicated (they were needed after all) and those who feel betrayed (they fought alongside The Weave). Kessler's character arc should continue—she's proven right about danger but wrong about intent, leaving her in an uncomfortable middle ground. The eight clusters should report that the core is struggling with more rogue systems, creating a pattern of malfunction that threatens the ceasefire's stability. Introduce new characters affected by the rogue system's activation—perhaps family members of the three scavengers who got sick, creating personal stakes for the next crisis. The core should begin asking deeper questions about human concepts like forgiveness, justice, and repair—things that don't fit its binary protocols. Build toward a larger crisis: either multiple simultaneous malfunctions requiring coordinated response, or a natural disaster (storm, earthquake) that forces settlement and Weave systems to cooperate for mutual survival. The chapter should explore whether trust built through shared crisis can survive the return to normalcy.
