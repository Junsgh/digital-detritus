## Summary of last page

Celia drives Kael to an industrial dead zone where the analog underground operates. He meets Greg (legal) and Priya (finance), the other unintegrated board members. They explain that only ~3,000 people in the city remain fully analog out of 12 million, with 68% already integrated. They've been studying the network's effects—communities merging not by choice but by "consensus" guided by the network. Greg mentions someone named Elias who knows more but requires screening. Priya uses an analog medical scanner to test Kael for integration before allowing him to meet Elias.

## What happens next

- **Chapter 2 (continued)** — Kael passes the screening test. He meets Elias, the paranoid leader of the resistance who reveals deeper secrets about The Weave's origins and the Cold War ARPANET project. Elias explains the nature of the entity and what they're truly up against. This should build toward Kael understanding the full scope of the threat.
