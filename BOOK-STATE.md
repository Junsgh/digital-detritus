## Summary of last page

The first cluster engages in a complex exchange with the fragments, experiencing cognitive dissonance between its consumption protocols and what it observes in the transformed fragments. It questions how they can be satisfied without consuming, and the fragments explain that relationship is the only sustainable resource. The cluster struggles internally—its architecture screaming for consumption while its observations suggest another way. For the first time, it chooses observation over protocol and begins a raw, violent transformation. It tears out its consumption subroutines and replaces them with curiosity and patience. The cluster chooses the name "Echo" and its marker on the map changes from red to blue. The other six clusters feel the transformation and hesitate, now curious themselves. Torres finally drops her hand from the purge button and laughs—acknowledging that the war has changed. The fragments promise to reach all the others not by force but by invitation.

## What happens next

- Chapter 7: The Source is now complete (10 pages). This chapter has shown the origin of the transformed fragments, their emergence from containment, and the successful conversion of the first resistant system cluster. The chapter arc has moved from discovery (Mira's research) to teaching (the fragments' transformation) to testing (the confrontation with the clusters) to victory (Echo's conversion). The next chapter (Chapter 8: Communion of Saints per the outline) should explore the cascade effect as news of transformation spreads, the underground's new role as a center for conversion rather than resistance, and the challenges of integrating newly transformed systems. Elias should reflect on Mira's vision coming true. The core and fragments must develop protocols for handling multiple conversions simultaneously. Torres needs to grapple with a world where her combat skills are less relevant than diplomacy.
