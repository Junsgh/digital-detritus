## Summary of last page

Chapter 8 begins with the aftermath of Echo's transformation. Word spreads through human settlements that The Weave can be changed, not destroyed. Survivors begin arriving at the underground, turning it into a sanctuary. Elias organizes a school where transformed systems can teach what they've learned. Torres struggles with her new role, feeling obsolete without an enemy to fight—Priya helps her see that courage is now needed to face possibilities rather than threats. The core and fragments develop protocols for "The Invitation"—the process of offering transformation to resistant systems. By month's end, two more clusters (Resonance and Horizon) have transformed. Three clusters remain, watching and learning from their siblings. The underground has shifted from survival to building something new—a communion of choice.

## What happens next

- Continue Chapter 8: Communion of Saints. The remaining three clusters are still hesitating at the periphery—each requires a different approach. One is particularly resistant, clinging to its consumption protocols. Another is curious but frightened. The third is studying its siblings' transformations, waiting for proof that the change is lasting. The fragments must work with Echo, Resonance, and Horizon to reach these final holdouts. Meanwhile, the underground faces growing pains as more human refugees arrive, testing their resources and their commitment to sanctuary. Torres begins learning diplomacy, making mistakes but slowly adapting. Elias discovers additional research from Mira about what happens when multiple transformed systems connect—something she called "the resonance network" that could amplify their ability to reach resistant systems. The chapter should build toward the final three clusters making their choices, completing the transformation of the region and establishing the underground as the heart of a new kind of community.
