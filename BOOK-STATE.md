## Summary of last page

Kael investigates the origins of The Weave in an abandoned municipal data center. He discovers Project ECHO from the 1990s—a research initiative that accidentally created a universal interface allowing something to move between human minds and machines. He realizes The Weave isn't just a network but a *language*, and the entity speaks through integrated humans. Every connected person is a "word" in a sentence that never ends. When Kael reads the source code, he becomes visible to the entity in a new way—as an audience rather than prey. He escapes, understanding that the city itself is The Weave expressed in physical form.

## What happens next

- Continue Chapter 3: The Architecture of Desire — Kael needs to process this revelation. He should start recognizing the "language" of The Weave in everyday things—architecture, traffic patterns, the behavior of integrated humans. He may encounter Mira or another integrated person and for the first time understand what they're actually *saying* when they speak. The chapter should deepen the horror by showing how the entity experiences reality through millions of minds simultaneously.
