## Summary of last page

Priya begins her work to evolve The Weave from within, starting at the periphery with the most recent integrations. She helps a young man in Nairobi and others reclaim their individual identities while remaining connected to the network, creating a new sub-network of autonomous minds. Her success draws the attention of The Weave's ancient core—the foundational patterns from the earliest integrations—which confronts her, accusing her of destabilizing the collective. Priya stands her ground, arguing for balance over consumption, and the newly strengthened individuals rally to protect her. The core reluctantly permits her to continue, warning that it will intervene if her evolution weakens the network. As Priya celebrates this victory, she senses Kael in the tunnel and realizes the dead zone generators are failing.

## What happens next

- Continue Chapter 4: Dreams of Electric Gods — With the dead zone generators failing, Kael, Vera, and Elias face an urgent decision. Do they attempt repairs, flee to find another dead zone, or risk exposure to The Weave's influence? Priya, now integrated, can sense their danger but can she communicate with them from within the network? The chapter should resolve Chapter 4's arc: either Priya finds a way to bridge the gap between integrated and analog worlds, or the group in the tunnel must make a desperate choice. This sets up Chapter 5: The Disconnected, where the consequences of their decision unfold and Kael's journey to find the analog underground truly begins.
