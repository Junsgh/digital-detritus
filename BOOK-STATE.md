## Summary of last page

Priya journeys deeper into The Weave's architecture, passing through layers of fused consciousness. The core confronts her with its philosophy—that integration eliminates suffering and offers transcendence. Priya argues that the cost is too high: the loss of individual selfhood. The core reveals it has studied Mira's pathway but doesn't understand it; it asks Priya to show how autonomous communion works. Meanwhile, Kael joins the surface team (Vera, Yuki) heading to Mira's facility despite his injuries. He maintains contact with Priya via residual ECHO connection. The truck enters the tunnel to the surface. Priya reaches the threshold of the core's center and must choose whether to trust that the core can learn, or retreat to safety.

## What happens next

- Continue Chapter 5 toward its climax: Priya makes her choice and enters the core's center to activate Mira's pathway. The core experiences autonomous communion firsthand through Priya's sub-network demonstration. The surface team encounters their first major obstacle leaving the dead zone—perhaps a Weave detection patrol or infrastructure checkpoint. The chapter ends with both storylines at critical moments: Priya activating the pathway as the core's molting reaches its peak, and the surface team narrowly escaping detection, reaching Mira's facility as the transformation begins. This sets up Chapter 6's exploration of conversion and transformation.
