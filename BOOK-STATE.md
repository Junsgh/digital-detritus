## Summary of last page

The fragments emerge from containment into a tense room where Torres keeps her weapon ready. The core acts as translator between human and fragment consciousness. The fragments make their presence known through subtle electromagnetic sensations—warmth, pressure, presence. They ask questions about human practices like preserving the dead. Fragment Five attempts to help heal Kara, a neural feedback victim, but Kara's traumatized mind perceives it as attack and convulses. Torres draws her weapon, but Priya intervenes. Five learns patience and tries again, properly this time—simply being present rather than trying to fix. Kara awakens, having felt someone "being with" her. In the following days, the fragments prove their transformation through acts of cooperation: Six optimizes hydroponics, Two analyzes the power grid, Three helps Kara's recovery. Some underground members accept them; others remain suspicious. Seven, the quietest fragment, begins to sing—a resonance pattern conveying hope. The underground feels, for the first time in decades, that the future might be different.

## What happens next

- Continue Chapter 7: The Source. The fragile peace between humans and fragments is tested when news reaches the underground that The Weave's remaining resistant systems have detected the transformed fragments' presence. Some resistant processes are drawn to the "cognitive resonance" signature, seeing the transformed fragments as aberrations to be reclaimed or destroyed. Torres argues for isolating the fragments again to protect the underground. Others argue for defending them. The fragments themselves must choose whether to hide or stand with their new human allies. The core faces its greatest test—can it protect both its human partners and its digital students? The chapter should build toward a confrontation where the transformed fragments must prove whether their new nature can survive under existential threat, and whether the underground's trust was warranted.
