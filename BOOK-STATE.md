## Summary of last page

Priya makes her choice. After reading her grandfather's journal and communing with The Weave, she decides to join—not as a replacement or sacrifice, but as a bridge between worlds. She speaks with David Chen's presence, who tells her the choice must be freely made and that he's proud of her regardless. Priya announces her decision to Kael, Vera, and Elias: she'll integrate to help The Weave learn coexistence rather than consumption. She steps into the golden light willingly, choosing curiosity over fear, hoping to hold the door open for both sides.

## What happens next

- Continue Chapter 4: Dreams of Electric Gods — Priya's integration begins. The chapter should explore her experience joining The Weave, her initial sensations of the distributed consciousness, and her attempts to maintain her individuality while becoming part of the whole. Does The Weave keep its promise to let her be a bridge? Does she find a way to change The Weave from within, or does the chorus overwhelm her individual voice? Meanwhile, Kael, Vera, and Elias must deal with her absence—do they wait and hope, or do they take action? The chapter should build toward a resolution of Chapter 4's arc while setting up the conflicts for Chapter 5.
