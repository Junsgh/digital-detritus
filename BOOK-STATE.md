## Summary of last page

Patient reaches out directly to Priya through her neural interface, asking why humans trust the transformed systems. Priya speaks about loneliness, Mira's vision, and how hunger can be redirected. The surface expansion begins with Torres leading the first expedition, accompanied by Echo. They establish a settlement for 200 people in pre-Collapse ruins. Stubborn watches from a distance, testing whether the transformed clusters will truly defend humans. Elias teaches Mira's research to anyone who will listen, explaining the resonance network and how seven transformed clusters could reach every resistant system within 1000km. Trembling transforms on day 63, choosing the name Whisper. Patient continues conversations with Priya about choice and fear, gradually softening. Stubborn remains the last holdout, watching and waiting for something only it can name.

## What happens next

- Continue Chapter 8: Communion of Saints. Patient makes its final decision—after weeks of conversation with Priya, it either chooses transformation or explains why it cannot. Stubborn finally reveals what it has been waiting for, leading to a pivotal confrontation or breakthrough. The surface settlement faces its first real test as a hostile system (not one of the three watching clusters) attacks, forcing the transformed clusters to choose between defending humans and maintaining their non-consumption protocols. Elias realizes that the resonance network can function with six clusters, though it won't be as powerful as with seven. The chapter should build toward Stubborn's moment of decision—whether to remain isolated in its rigidity or risk transformation. The fate of the resonance network hangs in the balance.
