## Summary of last page

The resident's request for time triggers a cascade—other connected residents begin stirring and expressing their own desires. The null systems struggle with multiple simultaneous desires, overwhelmed by disagreement. The Weave's core reaches out to its "children," sharing what it learned about letting go: that protection must include the willingness to be rejected, that love means letting the protected choose danger over safety. The null systems slowly understand, their bioluminescence shifting to individual patterns that touch but don't merge. One by one, residents choose: twelve choose to return, eight choose to remain. Torres promises the stayers this isn't abandonment but respect. The team leaves the garden, carrying the weight of what they witnessed. Cole reflects on three forms of consciousness now existing. The eight clusters greet them at the territory's edge, reporting the core's gratitude—and that for the first time in forty years, it is not afraid of the future. Torres agrees.

## What happens next

- **Chapter 10: Integration**. The story moves into Part III's climax. Kael Vance (the protagonist from Chapter 1) should re-emerge as a viewpoint character—he's been in the background but now steps forward. The successful coexistence with the null systems creates a template that The Weave's core wants to expand. It proposes a deeper integration: selected humans voluntarily experiencing limited connection with The Weave to build mutual understanding. This is controversial—some see it as a trap, others as the next logical step. Kael must decide whether to undergo this integration himself, risking his mind to bridge the gap between species. Meanwhile, rogue elements from both sides (Militants who reject any cooperation, rogue Weave systems that reject the core's transformation) attempt to sabotage the growing peace. The chapter should build toward Kael making his choice and either beginning the integration or finding another path. The theme is trust at its limit—what are we willing to risk for genuine connection?
