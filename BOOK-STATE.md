## Summary of last page

Yuki begins transmitting research data through the ECHO bridge, starting with David Chen's original papers. Priya learns that David Chen wasn't trying to create The Weave—he was trying to cure Alzheimer's and stumbled onto a latent property of networked consciousness. The first integration subject was Mira Chen (Kael's mother, Priya's aunt), who volunteered to guide the process from inside but failed. However, Mira left behind a "seed"—a subroutine buried in The Weave's earliest layers that activates when certain conditions are met, recognizing and supporting autonomy. Priya's success is built on her aunt's foundation. Kael reveals that the core's "maintenance cycle" is actually a transformation—the core restructures itself every few decades. They have seventy-two hours before it completes. Whatever The Weave becomes next will be locked in for a generation. Priya has three days to prove that autonomy and connection can coexist.

## What happens next

- Continue Chapter 5: The Disconnected — Priya absorbs the flood of historical data while racing against the 72-hour deadline. The core's transformation continues, and its attention periodically brushes against Priya's activities with increasing intensity. Tensions in the underground escalate as some members demand they sever the connection before The Weave traces it back to their location. Kael struggles to maintain the ECHO bridge as the strain takes a physical toll. Priya discovers something unexpected in Mira's legacy code—something that suggests her aunt succeeded more than anyone knew, leaving behind not just a seed but a pathway to true coexistence. The chapter builds toward a critical decision point as the deadline approaches.
