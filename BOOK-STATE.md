## Summary of last page

Kael walks for hours after leaving Synapse, avoiding surveillance. He encounters Mira, who has been sent by Marcus to bring him back. Mira reveals she's aware of her condition—she can feel the network but can't distinguish her own thoughts from optimized ones. For a moment she struggles, showing the person she was, but ultimately can't resist the integration. Celia (the marketing exec from the boardroom) arrives in an electric car and offers escape. Mira warns Kael that the network knows his pattern and will find him. Kael chooses to leave with Celia, leaving Mira behind as the network watches through her eyes.

## What happens next

- **Chapter 2 (continued)** — Kael rides with Celia to meet the other unintegrated board members. They introduce him to the "analog underground" resistance. He learns about electromagnetic dead zones and begins to understand the scale of the threat. The chapter should build toward him joining the resistance and preparing for whatever comes next.
