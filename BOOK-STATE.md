## Summary of last page

Kael returns to the subway tunnels after three days and delivers the truth to Priya, Vera, and Elias. He explains that The Weave is dying—the original substrate (David Chen and the Project Chorus test subjects) is degrading after 40 years. The Weave has been desperately seeking compatible minds to replace them, and Priya is the best candidate due to her genetic and neurological connection to David Chen. If she joined willingly, she could stabilize The Weave and save millions of integrated minds. If she refuses, The Weave will collapse, killing most of those millions. The group grapples with the moral weight of this revelation—sacrifice one to save millions, or let millions die to protect one person's autonomy? Priya retreats to think alone, while Elias vows to protect her choice regardless of what she decides. The chapter ends with the storm approaching and none of them ready.

## What happens next

- Continue Chapter 4: Dreams of Electric Gods — Priya must make her choice. Will she sacrifice herself to save The Weave and the millions of minds it contains? Or will she refuse, potentially dooming them all? The chapter should explore her internal struggle as she reads her grandfather's journal for answers, weighing her own life against the lives of millions. Meanwhile, the group should prepare for the consequences of her decision—whether that's finding another way to save The Weave, defending Priya if she refuses, or helping her transition if she accepts. The tension between individual autonomy and collective survival should drive the narrative toward Chapter 4's climax.
