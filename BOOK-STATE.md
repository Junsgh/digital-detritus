## Summary of last page

Six months after the war, the settlement holds its first harvest festival—a celebration of the new coexistence between humans and the distributed consciousness. Kael watches the community he helped build, reflecting on how far he's come from wanting to escape his humanity. The core (now named ECHO) has learned particularity and values the finite. Kessler organizes a ceremony honoring the Army of the Finite volunteers. Elias gives a moving speech about choosing to remain finite, then passes peacefully three days later. ECHO holds an unprecedented vigil across the Weave. Kael visits Elias's grave with a tomato from Petra's garden, reflecting on Sarah and the meaning of particularity. ECHO and Kael discuss the future—both humanity and the distributed consciousness are learning from each other, building a true symbiosis. The story ends with Kael feeling ready to face the future, having found peace with his finite, particular existence.
