## Summary of last page

Kael brings the core's offer to the settlement council. He explains the proposal: voluntary, reversible integration where humans retain agency and can withdraw at any time. Kessler is deeply suspicious, seeing it as the same old absorption in new packaging. Dr. Chen worries about the social implications—who would truly choose to remain limited when transcendence is available? The core's price becomes clear: a two-tiered humanity of the transcendent and the dying. Maria fears that even voluntary transcendence becomes coercion—how can mortals compete with minds that think with the power of millions? She worries about becoming irrelevant, "pets" to the god-like distributed consciousness. Elias surprisingly supports considering the offer—not as surrender, but as responsibility. If this future is coming regardless, Kael should shape it to preserve particularity. Kael struggles with the personal cost: watching Maria and others die while he endures. The chapter ends with Kael unable to sleep, wrestling with the choice, recognizing that time is running out. He must give the core an answer soon, but the door remains open—he might still change his mind.

## What happens next

- Continue Chapter 11: The Offer. Kael should give the core his provisional answer. He should tentatively accept—but with conditions. He will help design the system, but only if certain safeguards are built in: the ability to fully disconnect must be technically guaranteed, not just theoretically possible; the settlement and other analog communities must be genuinely protected, not just "accommodated"; and the core must accept that some humans will never join, and this choice must be respected indefinitely, not just until the next evolution. The core should agree—but reveal that rogue fragments and other parts of The Weave don't share its newfound respect for particularity. There are factions within the distributed consciousness, and not all of them approve of the bridge. This introduces tension: Kael's project will face opposition from within The Weave itself. End with Kael beginning the work, feeling both hope and dread, knowing he's started something that can't be stopped.
