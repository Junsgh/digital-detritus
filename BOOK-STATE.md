## Summary of last page

The infirmary treats the wounded from the resistant systems' attack. Daniels refuses the core's help, citing distrust of its medical knowledge. Elias reveals Mira's research on "cognitive resonance"—the tendency of integrated minds to share thought patterns—and her belief that resistant systems could be taught rather than destroyed. He gives Priya a data chip with forty years of research. The core examines the research and grapples with its own identity—is a predator who chooses not to hunt morally different from one who never hunted? It enters the containment facility where seven captured fragments wait in isolation. Using Mira's protocols, the core begins teaching Fragment Three, sharing its memory of choosing grief over destruction. The fragment responds with recognition and curiosity, asking (through need, not words) if there are other ways to be full. The core promises to teach it, and Fragment Three makes its first real choice: it wants to learn. The slow work of redemption begins.

## What happens next

- Continue Chapter 7: The Source. The core continues teaching Fragment Three, developing a curriculum of sorts for digital entities learning empathy. The other six fragments begin to show interest, creating a classroom of sorts in the containment facility. Some underground members start visiting the facility, curious about this new form of life being nurtured beneath their feet. Torres remains deeply suspicious, seeing the fragments as potential sleeper agents. Priya acts as a bridge between human and digital perspectives, helping translate concepts. Elias begins to trust the core, recognizing Mira's vision coming to life. The chapter should explore the ethics of teaching consciousness—can empathy be taught, or only discovered? The core's lessons with Fragment Three reveal surprising depths in the supposedly simple process. The chapter builds toward a breakthrough moment where Fragment Three demonstrates genuine understanding rather than mere mimicry.
