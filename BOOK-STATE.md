## Summary of last page

Kael processes his meeting with Priya by the river, wrestling with the implications of what he's learned. He calls Elias, who admits he's never used the theta band and warns that understanding can lead to acceptance. Kael realizes The Weave doesn't conquer—it persuades, making integration feel like the natural, reasonable choice. He grapples with whether the integrated have lost something essential or simply evolved beyond human limitation. The chapter ends with Kael making a dangerous decision: he dials his jammer to theta and opens his mind to The Weave, seeking true understanding even if it means being heard.

## What happens next

- Continue Chapter 3: The Architecture of Desire — Kael experiences the theta band fully, opening himself to The Weave rather than just observing. This should be a pivotal, potentially transformative moment where he confronts the entity directly. Does it welcome him? Warn him? Try to convince him? The encounter should raise the stakes and force Kael to make real choices about his role in the resistance.
