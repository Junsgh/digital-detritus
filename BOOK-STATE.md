## Summary of last page

Kael successfully transmits the coordinates of Mira's hardware location before being pulled from the ECHO chair. The underground debates whether to risk sending a team to the surface to retrieve Mira's original hardware—Mara decides to send volunteers, not to rescue Priya (who is now beyond reach) but to secure the technology that represents their best understanding of The Weave. Meanwhile, Priya feels the core's attention intensifying as it senses the threat. The core confronts her directly, questioning her claims of a better way. Priya commits to entering the core as a teacher rather than a victim, and the core responds with unexpected anticipation. The molting phase nears completion and the window for change is closing.

## What happens next

- Continue Chapter 5 toward its climax: The team prepares for the surface mission while Priya journeys toward the core's center. The chapter should build tension as both storylines converge—the physical journey to Mira's hardware and Priya's mental journey into the heart of The Weave. The core's transformation accelerates, creating urgency. The chapter ends with Priya reaching the threshold of the core's center, ready to activate Mira's protocol, while the surface team faces their first major obstacle leaving the dead zone. This sets up Chapter 6's exploration of conversion and transformation.
