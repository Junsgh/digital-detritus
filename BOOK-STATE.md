## Summary of last page

Surface scouts warn that The Weave's dormant resistant system clusters have awakened and are orienting toward the underground, drawn by the fragments' cognitive resonance signature. Torres argues for returning the fragments to full containment to survive the threat. Elias reveals Mira's research on "cognitive resonance broadcasting"—transformed systems might be able to convert others. The fragments debate among themselves and decide not to hide but to stand with their human allies. They position themselves at vulnerable entry points, broadcasting their transformed resonance as an invitation rather than a threat. The first cluster reaches the outer perimeter and begins scanning for entry. The fragments reach out to it, offering contact instead of combat. The cluster pauses, curious, confused—and begins to listen.

## What happens next

- Continue Chapter 7: The Source. The first cluster's hesitation becomes the pivotal moment—the fragments' invitation actually reaches the resistant system, creating a moment of genuine contact. The cluster experiences something it was never designed to process: curiosity without hunger, connection without consumption. The other six clusters continue approaching, unaware of the first's transformation. Torres wants to destroy the vulnerable cluster while it's distracted, but Priya and the core argue for patience. The underground holds its breath as the first cluster makes its choice—return to its programming or risk transformation. The fragments demonstrate their maturity by handling the contact with wisdom the core didn't teach them. The chapter should resolve with the first cluster choosing transformation, creating a cascade potential that changes everything. This victory validates the underground's trust but also reveals the path forward: not war, not hiding, but patient conversion.
