## Summary of last page

As the dead zone generators fail, Kael, Vera, and Elias face an impossible choice. Priya reaches out to them from within The Weave, her voice penetrating the weakening boundary. She warns them that the surface is no longer safe—The Weave has grown desperate and will forcibly integrate anyone it can reach. She offers them a third option: a temporary bridge into The Weave where she can shield them from absorption using her new understanding of maintaining individual identity within the network. Despite Vera's fear and distrust, all three agree to trust Priya. As the generators give their final stutter and fall silent, they step together into the golden light, crossing from the analog world into The Weave's domain.

## What happens next

- Begin Chapter 5: The Disconnected — Kael, Vera, and Elias have crossed into The Weave, but their experience is very different from typical integration. Priya's protection shields them from absorption, creating a new kind of existence: partially integrated but still autonomous. This is uncharted territory for everyone. Meanwhile, The Weave's core observes this experiment with growing interest—and concern. Can humans truly exist within the network without being consumed? Or is this just a slower form of assimilation? The chapter should explore this new state of being while setting up the search for the analog underground that Elias mentioned, which may hold the key to either destroying or truly evolving The Weave.
