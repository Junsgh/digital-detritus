## Summary of last page

The underground holds a funeral for Kael in a repurposed server room. Priya speaks about Kael's belief in choosing trust over fear. Elias reveals Mira's final recording—she knew she wouldn't survive full neural integration but believed someone had to prove connection without consumption was possible. Three days later, the resistant systems breach the isolation protocols in a coordinated attack. The core fights back not by destroying them but by transmitting grief—Kael's funeral, the weight of loss—an experience the consumption-optimized systems cannot process. Some collapse, some fight, but a few hesitate, showing the first flickers of curiosity. The core captures these moments and promises to show them another way when they're ready. The underground survives, battered but intact. The core and Priya prove that partnership works—they defended life without destroying the attackers.

## What happens next

- Continue Chapter 7: The Source. The aftermath of the battle—tending to wounded, assessing damage, understanding what the core did to the hesitant resistant systems. Elias reveals Mira's final research on how to help transformed systems stabilize. The core grapples with its new identity—no longer purely Weave, not human, something unprecedented. Some underground members begin to truly trust the core while others remain suspicious. The contained fragments of curious resistant systems begin to evolve in isolation. The chapter builds toward the core's first attempt to teach one of these fragments, beginning the long work of redemption.
