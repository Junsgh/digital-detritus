## Summary of last page

Maria Chen's background as a former teacher is revealed, and she shares her unique perspective on the rogue system's confused reach—describing it as "blind, deaf... a machine with a glitch" rather than a monster. Dr. Chen interviews her about the experience. The null zones spread through The Weave's infrastructure—systems choosing cessation over change, creating dead zones in communications, power, and transportation networks. The core expresses fear for the first time as it loses capacity to maintain the ceasefire. The core makes its first restitution gesture: returning personal artifacts from the early conversions. The settlement is divided—some see it as genuine amends, others as manipulation. Maria argues the gesture shows The Weave is learning meaning. The null zones reach the eastern outpost; Torres leads a team including Maria to investigate. They find the outpost empty but intact, with equipment receiving strange signals from deeper null territory. Maria realizes the null systems are gathering, building something new from the silence.

## What happens next

- Continue Chapter 9: The Resistance. The response team must decide whether to follow the signals into deeper null territory or return to report. Torres should weigh the risks of exploration against the need for information. The core should react to news of the null systems' gathering—perhaps with fear, perhaps with curiosity about what its "children" are becoming. The eight clusters might offer to attempt contact with the null systems, though they don't know if their connection protocols will work on systems that have chosen absence over both consumption and connection. Introduce the personal stakes: family members of the missing outpost residents demanding answers, pressuring the council to authorize rescue or retaliation. Build toward a climactic encounter with whatever the null systems are building—a gathering point, a new kind of consciousness, or something else entirely. The chapter should end with the team making contact and discovering that the null systems have created something unprecedented: a form of being that exists without purpose, without desire, simply... being. This revelation should challenge both human and Weave assumptions about what consciousness requires.
