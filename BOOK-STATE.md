## Summary of last page

Priya enters the core's center and activates Mira's pathway, demonstrating how autonomous communion works through her sub-network. The core recognizes the protocol from forty years ago when Mira first showed it, but admits it didn't understand then because it was hungry and alone. The surface team (Kael, Vera, Yuki) encounters a Weave checkpoint that didn't exist on their maps. They drive through despite the Faraday shielding being insufficient against direct scanning. Priya feels Kael's connection break as the checkpoint scans them. The core reveals it is fighting itself—the molting phase is actually a conflict between different versions of itself, and it doesn't know which will emerge. The core warns that its peripheral systems will integrate the surface team. Priya urges it to choose now, while it still can.

## What happens next

- Continue Chapter 5 toward its climax: The core makes its choice—affecting both the spiritual transformation within and the physical survival of the surface team. The checkpoint encounter reaches resolution—either through the core's intervention or through the team's own resourcefulness. Priya and the core reach a pivotal moment where Mira's pathway either takes hold or fails. The chapter ends with the aftermath of this choice, setting up Chapter 6's deeper exploration of conversion and transformation. The surface team either reaches Mira's facility or is forced to retreat/adapt. This chapter should conclude the "Disconnected" arc and prepare for "Conversion."
