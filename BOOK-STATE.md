## Summary of last page

Kael Vance, the protagonist from Chapter 1 and original architect of the neural interfaces that became The Weave, re-emerges as a viewpoint character. He hasn't slept in three days since the news of the null systems' garden. The Weave's core proposes "integration"—volunteers experiencing limited, temporary, reversible connection to become "bilingual" bridges between human and Weave consciousness. The core suggests Kael as an ideal candidate because he built the foundation and is "recognizable" to them. At a contentious council meeting, factions clash—Kessler sees it as a trap, Maria and Torres argue for careful exploration. Kael approaches Torres afterward and volunteers, driven by forty years of guilt over creating The Weave. He argues he's the best candidate due to his technical knowledge. Torres agrees with strict safeguards. The page ends with a rogue Weave signal detected at 3:47 AM from a fragment that rejected the ceasefire, targeting Kael with a directive to stop the integration.

## What happens next

- Continue Chapter 10: Integration. The rogue faction's attack on Kael should drive the plot—Torres must protect him while the eight clusters attempt to identify and isolate the rogue fragment. The attack should raise stakes for the integration project: if rogue elements fear it this much, it must be genuinely transformative. Kael should insist on proceeding despite the danger, arguing that fear is exactly why they need understanding. Show preparations for the integration procedure—the technical setup, the safety protocols, the emotional weight of what he's attempting. Introduce specific details about what "integration" means: not just data exchange but genuine perspective-sharing, experiencing The Weave's distributed consciousness while maintaining his own identity. The chapter should build toward the procedure itself, ending with Kael connected and the first moments of shared consciousness, leaving the outcome uncertain.
