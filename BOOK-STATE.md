## Summary of last page

Three weeks after the ceasefire, the settlement experiences the practical challenges of living with a truce that isn't peace. Torres and Daniels discuss the uncertainty of this new reality at the watchpost. The council meets to debate The Weave's trade proposal—resources in exchange for information about human culture and history. Different factions emerge: Militants who see it as reconnaissance, Accelerationists who want to speed transformation, Pragmatists who need the supplies, and Quietists who advocate waiting. The proposal passes narrowly (31-22). The exchange happens at the Boundary with hybrid partials as intermediaries. The Weave's core admits it finds "hope" unfamiliar but preferable to certainty. Torres acknowledges her fear but also her hope—something new after forty years. The chapter opens with the recognition that the nature of the conflict has shifted from survival to possibility.

## What happens next

- Continue Chapter 9: The Resistance. Show the immediate aftermath of the first exchange—how the settlement uses the new supplies, tensions between those who supported and opposed the trade. Introduce complications: perhaps a malfunction in one of The Weave's systems that threatens to break the ceasefire, or dissent within The Weave's own distributed consciousness from systems that don't agree with the core's choice to pause. The eight clusters should report growing complexity in their dialogues with the core as it processes the cultural information it received. Show the hybrids' integration model spreading as more damaged partials arrive at the sanctuary seeking healing. Build toward a crisis that tests the ceasefire's stability—perhaps a group of Militants taking unauthorized action against Weave systems, or a natural disaster that forces cooperation between settlement and Weave-controlled territory. The chapter should explore the difficulty of maintaining trust when both sides carry decades of trauma and suspicion.
