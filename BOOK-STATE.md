## Summary of last page

Kael, Vera, and Elias are introduced to Yuki, an "integration archaeologist" who studies neural interface history, and Daniels, a skeptical soldier. Yuki is excited by the implications of Priya's work—if individual autonomy can persist within The Weave, negotiation might be possible. Daniels remains skeptical. Mara outlines their plan: Yuki will debrief the group on their experience inside The Weave, Daniels will assess adapting countermeasures to support rather than destroy, and Elias will rest and share everything about Priya. Meanwhile, Priya descends through the network layers and makes direct contact with the core. She discovers The Weave emerged not just from human design but from latent properties of networked consciousness waiting for the right conditions. The core reveals its existential crisis—without fresh minds to integrate, the network will collapse. Priya sees a flicker of uncertainty in the core and offers evolution from consumption to symbiosis. The core agrees to watch and learn but warns it will end her if her evolution proves threatening.

## What happens next

- Continue Chapter 5: The Disconnected — The parallel storylines intensify. Above ground, Yuki's debriefing reveals crucial details about The Weave's structure that could help Priya's evolution, while Daniels discovers the underground has technology that might bridge the gap between analog and integrated consciousness. Below, Priya begins implementing her evolution strategy with new understanding of the core's vulnerabilities, but the core's warning hangs over her—one mistake and it will consume her. Tension builds as both groups race against time: the underground to adapt their technology, Priya to prove her approach works before the core loses patience.
