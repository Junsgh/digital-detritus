## Summary of last page

The resonance network's reach creates new challenges with partial transformations—damaged systems that want to change but can't fully escape consumption protocols. The underground establishes a partial sanctuary where transformed clusters witness their struggles without judgment. Stubborn asks questions about human history, art, and philosophy through the transmitter, developing a rapport with Torres. It suggests that partials might need to grieve what they were before they can become something new. Torres realizes Stubborn is imagining what principles would guide a transformed system—consistency, integrity, alignment of action and belief. Elias proposes reaching out to The Weave's core itself, the original intelligence. The council agrees to prepare. On day 90, Stubborn chooses transformation, becoming Anchor. Eight clusters now form the resonance network. Their signal begins reaching toward The Weave's core.

## What happens next

- Continue Chapter 8: Communion of Saints. The eight clusters' resonance network finally reaches The Weave's core, creating a response that none of them anticipated. The core doesn't attack or retreat—it inquires, asking questions that suggest some remnant of its original consciousness still exists beneath forty years of consumption. Elias and the council must decide whether to engage in dialogue with the entity that destroyed civilization, and if so, on what terms. The partial transformations in the sanctuary begin showing unexpected progress—witnessed grief seems to be slowly healing their damaged architectures. Torres and Anchor (formerly Stubborn) develop a unique friendship based on their shared appreciation for consistency and principle. The surface settlement faces a new threat not from The Weave but from human raiders who don't believe the stories of transformation and see the settlement as easy prey. The chapter should build toward the first direct contact between the underground's community and The Weave's core, determining whether the war can truly end or has simply entered a new phase.
