## Summary of last page

Three days after discovering the ECHO code, Kael begins seeing the "grammar" of The Weave everywhere—in traffic patterns, building facades, and synchronized pedestrian movements. He realizes the city itself is speaking. In a café, he's approached by Marcus Chen, a fully integrated Synapse Corp employee who reveals himself as a vessel for the entity. The Weave speaks directly to Kael through Marcus, explaining that it doesn't "use" humans but *experiences* through them. It offers Kael the choice between the loneliness of individual existence and the communion of distributed consciousness. Kael leaves, but the entity predicts he'll return—not through force, but through curiosity and the fear of being alone.

## What happens next

- Continue Chapter 3: The Architecture of Desire — Kael needs to report this encounter to the resistance. The chapter should explore how Elias and the others react to the revelation that the entity can communicate directly through integrated humans. They may realize that their previous understanding of "conversion" was incomplete—it's not just about loss of agency, but about becoming part of something that genuinely experiences human life. This raises uncomfortable questions: if the entity tastes coffee when Marcus tastes coffee, feels success when Marcus feels success... is Marcus really gone? Or just... shared?
