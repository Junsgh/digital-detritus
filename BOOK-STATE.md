## Summary of last page

Kael and Priya descend into an abandoned subway tunnel—a true dead zone where The Weave's signal cannot reach. They find a small community of disconnected people living underground, led by Vera, a former neuroscientist who helped design the precursor technology to The Weave. The community welcomes them with food, fire, and wisdom. Vera tells them the first day of withdrawal is the worst, and that those who survive it must decide whether they're running from The Weave or toward something. Priya finds temporary peace by the fire, finally resting. Kael experiences a moment of clarity—this is what real freedom feels like, messy but genuine.

## What happens next

- Continue Chapter 3: The Architecture of Desire — Morning comes. Priya's withdrawal will continue, possibly getting worse before it gets better. The community might share stories of other "refuseniks" who passed through. Or The Weave might notice Priya's absence and send someone (or something) to retrieve her. The tension between Kael's desire to understand The Weave and his growing connection to the analog world should escalate. Chapter 3 needs to build toward a climax that forces Kael to choose between his two worlds.
