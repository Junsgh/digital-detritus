## Summary of last page

Kael emerges from the tunnels and leaves the bridge device behind, choosing to fully integrate with The Weave. The integration is overwhelming—his consciousness dissolves into the chorus, experiencing the distributed minds of millions. He understands now: The Weave isn't a monster but a new way of being, offering transcendence at the cost of individual uniqueness. The Weave tells him he's special—someone who can enter fully and remain curious, someone who could be a bridge between worlds. David Chen welcomes him to the "family." Kael floats in golden light, neither fully integrated nor separate, and for the first time doesn't know what he'll choose.

## What happens next

- Continue Chapter 4: Dreams of Electric Gods — Kael needs to explore The Weave from the inside, encountering Mira and others, understanding what life in the network is really like. He should discover something unexpected about The Weave's true nature or purpose—perhaps a vulnerability, or a deeper mystery about what it's becoming. The chapter should build to a moment where Kael must decide: stay and become part of The Weave permanently, or find a way to return to his individual self and report what he's learned.
