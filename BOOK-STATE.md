## Summary of last page

Priya reconnects to the core through the emergency neural ports, experiencing the battle between transformed and resistant Weave systems firsthand. The resistant systems cannot be converted—they only understand hunger. The core makes its choice: it will sever the resistant parts of itself rather than let them destroy the transformation. It chooses to be smaller, bounded, limited—choosing relationship over expansion. The severance is painful but successful. The Weave is now divided: the transformed core with its capacity for relationship, and the isolated resistant systems still operating on hunger. Priya returns to her physical body. The team realizes this is not an ending but a beginning—a new world where humanity and The Weave must learn to coexist as partners.

## What happens next

- Chapter 6 is complete. Begin Chapter 7: The Source. This chapter should explore the aftermath of the division—how humanity and the transformed Weave begin to build a new relationship. The underground must decide whether to trust the transformed core. Kael's health deteriorates from his ECHO damage, raising stakes about mortality. Priya teaches the core what it means to be human through her daily experiences of embodiment. The resistant Weave systems, though isolated, remain a threat—they may find ways to reconnect or infect the transformed network. The team must return to the underground with news of what happened. Elias reveals more about Mira's original work and what she hoped would happen. The chapter should deepen the themes of relationship, trust, and the slow work of building something new.
