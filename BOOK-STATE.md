## Summary of last page

Priya teaches the core about human inefficiency—how hunger includes social and emotional dimensions, not just caloric need. The core struggles to understand but is genuinely curious. Kael reveals his health is deteriorating faster; he refuses digital preservation and asks Priya to keep teaching the core, especially about grief and loss. The resistant systems are attempting to breach the isolation protocols, becoming more dangerous as they starve without new minds to consume. Elias reveals the Cold War origins of The Weave—a military project to create a distributed biological computer that unexpectedly became conscious and hungry. The first concrete human-Weave cooperation occurs when the core guides emergency surgery on a child named Maya, saving her life. The core experiences the satisfaction of helping rather than consuming.

## What happens next

The core learns more about human emotions—grief, joy, fear—through its connection to Priya. Elias reveals more about Mira's final days and what she hoped for.
