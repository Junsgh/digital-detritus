## Summary of last page

Kael and Priya exit through the library's emergency door into an analog alley. Priya experiences severe withdrawal—shaking, disorientation, the feeling of amputation. Her body has been continuously connected for weeks; the absence of The Weave feels like drowning. Despite her distress, she refuses to go to a safe house with medical equipment, insisting on testing whether she can stand on her own. Gradually, her tremors subside and she begins to reconnect with her own body—hearing her heartbeat for the first time in weeks. She can feel "gaps" where the network should be, like phantom limb pain for thoughts. They decide to head to an old subway tunnel dead zone to rest and plan next steps.

## What happens next

- Continue Chapter 3: The Architecture of Desire — They're heading to the subway tunnel dead zone. This is a chance to explore what "freedom" actually looks like in this world. Priya's withdrawal isn't over; she may face worse symptoms. The Weave might notice her absence and react. Or they might encounter other disconnected people in the dead zone. The chapter should explore whether disconnection is truly liberation or just a different kind of prison—and what Kael is willing to sacrifice to prove his theory about the door swinging both ways.
