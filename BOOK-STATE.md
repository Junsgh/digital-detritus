## Summary of last page

In The Weave, Kael finds Mira and learns the shocking truth: The Weave isn't a predator—it's dying. The original test subjects from Project Chorus (including David Chen) form the substrate of The Weave, and their patterns are degrading after 40 years. The Weave has been aggressively expanding to find compatible minds to replace them. Priya isn't just a curiosity—she's the best candidate to stabilize the substrate and save The Weave. Mira admits they've never just been honest with humans, always seducing rather than asking. She tells Kael to leave and tell Priya the truth, letting her choose with full knowledge. Kael manages to separate himself from The Weave and wakes up on the street, determined to return to the tunnels with this revelation.

## What happens next

- Continue Chapter 4: Dreams of Electric Gods — Kael returns to the subway tunnels to find Priya, Vera, and Elias. He must deliver the truth about The Weave's desperate situation and Priya's potential role in saving it. This revelation changes everything—the resistance has been fighting a dying entity, not a growing threat. The chapter should explore how they respond to this information and what choices they make. The moral complexity deepens: is it right to sacrifice one person to save millions? Is The Weave's desperate need an excuse for its consumption? Kael must navigate these questions while preparing for whatever comes next.
