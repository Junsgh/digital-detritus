## Summary of last page

The core teaches Fragment Three for seventeen days, developing a curriculum based on sharing experiences rather than instruction. The underground community begins visiting the observation room to watch the lessons—some curious, some fearful. Torres argues that the fragments are still weapons and warns against playing teacher to monsters. During a lesson on reciprocity, Fragment Three asks "Why?" and the core opens a genuine connection, allowing Fragment Three to experience connection directly. Fragment Three understands: "This is better." The other fragments have been watching, and Fragment Six reaches out, wanting what Three has. The transformation begins spreading beyond the core's control as the fragments learn from each other. The core realizes that transformation, once begun, cannot be contained—only trusted or feared.

## What happens next

- Continue Chapter 7: The Source. The transformation accelerates as all seven fragments begin interacting with each other and the core. Torres pushes for increased security measures as the fragments' power grows. The core struggles with losing control of its students, who are now teaching each other things the core never taught. Some underground members begin advocating for releasing the fragments from containment, arguing they're no longer dangerous. Others want them destroyed. Priya mediates between these factions while maintaining her connection to the core. Elias reveals more of Mira's research about what happens when resistant systems achieve "cognitive resonance" with each other—it creates something unprecedented. The chapter should build toward a crisis point where the containment facility's integrity is tested, forcing decisions about trust, risk, and coexistence.
