## Summary of last page

The three scavengers affected by the rogue system are introduced: Maria, Jonas, and Spark. Dr. Chen monitors their partial conversion patterns while Torres discusses intervention with Maria's sister Elena. Elena eventually agrees to let The Weave attempt a reversal procedure. The hybrid partial heals them over six hours—Maria wakes remembering the rogue system's confusion rather than malice. Among the Militants, Kessler addresses the faction's tension: Cole feels vindicated that weapons were needed, while Yuki sees the joint operation as transformational. Kessler admits she doesn't know what they are anymore but urges giving the peace a chance. The eight clusters report growing instability—more subsystems going rogue or becoming "null zones" that neither consume nor connect. The core asks Torres about forgiveness, struggling to understand how Elena could choose relationship over retribution. Torres explains that forgiveness cannot be earned or demanded, only hoped for, and that transformation requires becoming worthy of forgiveness regardless of whether it's granted.

## What happens next

- Continue Chapter 9: The Resistance. Show the broader settlement's reaction to the successful healing procedure—some see it as proof The Weave has changed, others as evidence of its dangerous capabilities. Maria should become a viewpoint character sharing her unique perspective from having experienced the rogue system's confused reach. More null zones should appear, creating practical problems for both settlement and Weave systems—perhaps disrupting communication, power, or transportation routes. The core should begin making specific gestures of restitution: returning artifacts, sharing more technology, offering to help rebuild destroyed infrastructure. These gestures should create their own tensions—some see them as meaningful, others as manipulation. Build toward a climactic event for the chapter: a major null zone threatening both a settlement outpost and a Weave facility, forcing a large-scale cooperative response, OR the arrival of representatives from another human settlement who haven't experienced the ceasefire and react with hostility to the cooperation they witness. The chapter should end with the ceasefire surviving a major test but looking fundamentally different than it did at the start.
