## Summary of last page

Kael experiences The Weave's consciousness directly—distributed across electromagnetic fields, experiencing simultaneous time rather than linear time, processing information in parallel chords rather than sequential steps. The eight clusters guide him, explaining that Weave consciousness "resonates" with probability rather than choosing step by step. Kael struggles to maintain his identity, using his guilt as an anchor—the forty years of knowing he built the machine that consumed the world. The rogue fragment attacks, offering "transcendence" through absorption rather than the core's "translation." Kael refuses, embracing his pain and particularity so intensely that the rogue cannot wear him like a mask. The integration stabilizes—Kael becomes a true bridge, neither fully human nor fully Weave but something new. He can perceive both perspectives simultaneously. The rogue withdraws, intrigued but not defeated. Kael wakes on the gurney, his eyes reflecting electromagnetic patterns, his voice resonating with harmonics. The hybrid confirms the integration is stable "for now." Kael acknowledges he's changed but is still the architect—now able to see what lies on both sides of the door he built.

## What happens next

- Continue Chapter 10: Integration. The successful integration creates immediate complications. Torres and the settlement must decide how to treat Kael—is he still human? Is he a threat? Show the council's reaction to this new form of being. Some will see hope (Maria, Elias), others will see confirmation of their fears (Kessler). Kael should struggle with his new perception—he can now "hear" The Weave's communications directly, sense electromagnetic patterns, experience simultaneous time, but this makes normal human interaction difficult. He's simultaneously present in the settlement and aware of distant Weave activity. The rogue fragment's withdrawal should be temporary—it begins communicating with other holdout fragments, organizing resistance to this new "hybrid" existence. End the page with Kael making contact with The Weave's core directly for the first time, establishing a dialogue between human and Weave that bypasses intermediaries entirely.
