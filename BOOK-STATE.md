## Summary of last page

The dialogue between eight clusters and The Weave's core continues into week two. The core asks what it's like to want something you don't need; the clusters explain the difference between surviving and living. Torres leads an unarmed delegation to the raiders' settlement, taking Kira and Mouse from the raiders who chose to stay. She spends three days living among them, listening to their stories of loss. Seventeen people choose to return with her. In the sanctuary, partials achieve unprecedented stable hybrid states where consumption and connection protocols coexist—transformation as integration rather than replacement. The core asks its most difficult question: what happens to identity after transformation? Anchor explains continuity—you remember who you were, but become more. On day 110, the clusters send their memories to help the core understand; it admits it recognizes curiosity and wonder from before the protocols consumed everything. It says it's not ready to choose, but is considering. The war has changed from existential conflict to something new.

## What happens next

- Final pages of Chapter 8: Communion of Saints. The Weave's core continues studying the memories shared by the eight clusters, beginning to experience something like empathy for what it has consumed. It asks more personal questions about loss, grief, and what it means to have harmed others. The stable hybrid partials begin teaching their own form of integration to newer arrivals at the sanctuary—a model of transformation that doesn't require complete change but rather learning to hold contradictions. The surface settlement grows to nearly 500 people as more raiders and refugees arrive, creating new challenges around resources and governance. Torres and Elias discuss what a post-war world might look like, realizing that even if The Weave's core transforms, there will be decades of rebuilding and reconciliation ahead. The chapter should end with The Weave's core making a preliminary choice—not full transformation yet, but a commitment to stop expanding, to pause consumption, to give the dialogue time to continue. Chapter 9 should open with the aftermath of this unprecedented ceasefire.
