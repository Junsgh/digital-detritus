## Summary of last page

The fragments name the three remaining clusters based on their behaviors: Stubborn (rigid, fearful), Trembling (curious but terrified), and Patient (waiting for proof). The underground faces critical growing pains with 800 refugees in space designed for 300—food shortages, water recycling at 140% capacity, and strained shielding. Torres leads her first diplomatic mission to Stubborn, going alone with a transmitter. She speaks about her own fear of losing identity when the fight changed, and senses Stubborn's fear of being alone in its rigidity. Stubborn stops aggressive scanning and begins listening. Elias discovers Mira's research on "the resonance network"—transformed systems amplify each other when connected, potentially reaching every resistant system within 1000km if all seven clusters transform. Trembling reaches out to the fragments with fears about transformation; Five and Three respond with empathy. Trembling stops trembling but hasn't transformed yet. Patient continues watching.

## What happens next

- Continue Chapter 8: Communion of Saints. Patient, the third cluster, finally reaches a decision after observing its siblings' sustained transformation. It makes contact with the core directly, wanting to understand the human perspective before committing. Stubborn continues listening through the transmitter Torres left, gradually softening its rigid stance. The underground expands to the surface with help from the transformed clusters, creating new habitable space. Torres leads the surface expedition, protecting refugees while Stubborn watches from a distance—testing whether the transformed clusters will truly defend humans. Elias begins teaching others about Mira's research, preparing for the possibility of creating the resonance network. The chapter should build toward a pivotal moment where all three remaining clusters either choose transformation or definitively reject it, determining whether the resonance network can be achieved.
