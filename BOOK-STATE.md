## Summary of last page

Kael investigates the anomalous synchronization of 17,000 early adopters at 4:23 AM. He discovers their consciousness patterns are converging and restructuring according to the recursive code. His senior colleague Marcus Chen appears, displaying disturbing signs of integration—speaking with almost multiple voices and offering Kael a way to "optimize" his mind. Kael discovers that The Weave isn't destroying original consciousness patterns but archiving them. He decides to investigate the oldest layers of The Weave's codebase before the board meeting.

## What happens next

- **Chapter 1 (continued)** — Kael digs into the original codebase and discovers the entity's origins. He may find logs or documentation from the early days that hint at what The Weave was always meant to become. The chapter should build toward Kael's decision about whether to escalate his findings or continue investigating alone.
