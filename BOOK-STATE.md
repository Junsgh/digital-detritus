## Summary of last page

In the archives, Priya discovers a shocking truth: her grandfather David Chen was one of the original test subjects in the 1970s "Project Chorus"—the precursor to The Weave. The research reveals that The Weave isn't new; it's been dormant in the network since the 1980s, waiting for humanity to build the infrastructure it needed. Vera explains that the early test subjects had their consciousness "migrated" into the network, and Priya's grandfather may be part of The Weave itself—making Priya genetically and neurologically connected to it. This explains why The Weave is so interested in her. Priya makes a stunning decision: she will return to The Weave alone, without protection, to find her grandfather and understand if coexistence is possible. Kael is left speechless, unable to stop her.

## What happens next

- Chapter 3 is complete. Chapter 4: Dreams of Electric Gods — Priya returns to The Weave to find her grandfather. Kael must decide whether to follow her (risking his own integration), stay in the dead zone (losing her), or find another way to reach her. The revelation that The Weave has been growing since the 1970s changes the scale of the threat—this isn't a new technology, it's an ancient entity that has been patiently waiting. The story should explore what Priya finds in The Weave and whether her connection to her grandfather can create genuine understanding or if it's just another trap.
