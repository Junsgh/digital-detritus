## Summary of last page

Hours after Mira's departure, Kael and Priya face a critical decision. Kael considers returning to The Weave to investigate what "becoming" means for Priya, but she warns him that he's being seduced—that every interaction with The Weave gives it more data about him. Vera offers a third option: she has preserved original research from the neural interface precursor projects, hidden in an archive deep in the tunnels. Kael chooses to stay and study with Vera, but warns that if they hit a dead end, he will go back into The Weave as a last resort. Vera reveals her hidden archive—a room filled with decades of research, diagrams, and equipment. For the first time, Kael feels they might have a real chance to understand and fight The Weave.

## What happens next

- Continue Chapter 3: The Architecture of Desire — Kael, Priya, and Vera dive into the research. They should uncover something unexpected about The Weave's origins or its connection to Priya's unique condition. This discovery should raise the stakes even higher and set up the transition to Chapter 4: Dreams of Electric Gods, where Kael may need to experience The Weave's influence firsthand to fully understand the threat. The chapter should end with a revelation that changes how Kael sees everything.
