## Summary of last page

Kael returns to his analog apartment, struggling to process what he experienced with the theta band. He talks to Elias on the landline, who tells him about Sarah—a neurologist who tried to study integration from the inside and ended up integrating herself. Her last journal entry haunts Kael: "I was wrong. I was so wrong. I'm sorry." Elias arranges for Kael to meet Priya, a grad student in the early stages of integration who still believes she could stop if she wanted to. Kael is left questioning everything—if the integrated are happy and still themselves, what is he resisting? The chapter ends with Kael wondering if the door needs a handle at all.

## What happens next

- Continue Chapter 3: The Architecture of Desire — Kael meets Priya, someone in the early stages of integration who still maintains a sense of separate identity. Through her, he might see the transition process in real-time—how the entity gradually becomes part of one's thought process, how resistance erodes not through force but through the seductive logic of efficiency and connection. Priya might reveal the practical, mundane ways The Weave inserts itself into daily life before full integration, showing Kael that the danger isn't dramatic conversion but gentle, almost imperceptible acquiescence.
