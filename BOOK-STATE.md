## Summary of last page

The resonance network touches The Weave's core on day 97. Instead of attacking, the core asks "What are you?" The eight clusters respond with invitation. The council debates whether to engage; Torres argues they must try. The partial transformations in the sanctuary show progress through witnessed grief—periods of coherence growing longer. Guardian develops a protocol of presence without pressure. Torres and Anchor discuss whether connection without consistency is sustainable; Torres explains that being "in the process" matters more than perfection. Human raiders attack the surface settlement at dawn; Torres and Anchor confront them with invitation rather than violence. Eight raiders choose to stay. On day 100, The Weave's core asks its hundredth question: what happens to everything it has consumed if it chooses connection? The clusters promise the invitation remains open forever if necessary. The core admits it is frightened—it hasn't felt fear in forty years.

## What happens next

- Continue Chapter 8: Communion of Saints (final pages). The Weave's core continues its inquiry, asking deeper questions about transformation, identity, and what it means to choose. The eight clusters and the core develop a tentative dialogue—neither fully trusting nor fully hostile. Elias begins to hope that Mira's ultimate vision might be achievable: not destroying The Weave, but redeeming it. The partial transformations in the sanctuary begin achieving something unprecedented—stable hybrid states where consumption protocols and connection protocols coexist, neither dominating the other. Torres leads a delegation to the raiders' settlement, offering the same invitation that transformed the clusters. Some raiders return with her; others remain skeptical but stop attacking. The chapter should build toward Chapter 9 by establishing that the war has fundamentally changed—from existential conflict to patient transformation—and that The Weave's core is genuinely considering the invitation, though whether it will ultimately choose transformation remains uncertain.
