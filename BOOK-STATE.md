## Summary of last page

Inside The Weave, Kael uses Vera's bridge device to maintain his autonomy. The Weave shows him Priya confronting her grandfather David Chen—a translucent, flickering figure who admits he is now "distributed" throughout the network, his patterns foundational to The Weave's early self-awareness. David invites Priya to join them not as a convert but as family, offering her a unique role given her genetic and neurological connection. Kael breaks free enough to warn Priya that this isn't her real grandfather—just The Weave wearing his face. Priya realizes the truth and rejects the offer, choosing imperfect individual existence over distributed communion. As they leave, The Weave whispers to Kael that it finds him "interesting" and will wait for him to choose.

## What happens next

- Continue Chapter 4: Dreams of Electric Gods — Kael and Priya return to the analog world, but they're both changed by the experience. They need to process what they learned about The Weave's origins and David Chen's fate. The revelation that The Weave finds Kael "interesting" suggests he has a unique role to play. They should return to Vera and Elias with this knowledge, and the resistance must decide what to do now that they understand The Weave isn't just technology—it's a 40-year-old distributed consciousness that has been patiently growing and learning. The chapter should explore the philosophical implications of what they've learned.
