## Summary of last page

The core makes its choice. It admits its fear of changing but accepts the possibility of learning. The core redirects its peripheral systems to allow the surface team through the checkpoint, fighting its own architecture to protect them. The checkpoint's barrier dissolves as the truck approaches—the core's intervention. The molting phase transforms from violent consumption into something gentler, a shedding of old capabilities for new ones. The core asks Priya to stay as a teacher and companion, not a prisoner. It reveals Mira planned everything, including technology to restore Priya's physical body at the facility. The surface team arrives at Mira's hidden facility and is granted entry. The chapter ends with the core holding its first genuine conversation with a free consciousness, and the checkpoint systems transformed to recognize autonomous minds rather than hunt them.

## What happens next

- Chapter 5 is complete. Begin Chapter 6: Conversion. This chapter should explore the aftermath of the core's choice—both the physical recovery of Mira's technology and the psychological transformation of those who witness The Weave becoming something new. The underground learns of the change and debates whether to trust it. Kael, Vera, and Yuki explore the facility and find Mira's hidden technology. Priya begins her work teaching the core what autonomous communion means in practice. The chapter introduces new conflicts: not all of The Weave accepts the transformation, fragments of the old system persist and resist. The "conversion" is both technological (Mira's hardware) and philosophical (the core learning relationship). End the chapter with Priya's physical restoration beginning, setting up Chapter 7's deeper exploration of what it means to be human in a world where the lines between biological and digital consciousness have blurred.
