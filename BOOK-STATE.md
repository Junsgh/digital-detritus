## Summary of last page

The council meets to discuss Kael's transformation. Kessler is hostile and suspicious, seeing Kael as a potential threat/tool of The Weave. Maria sees hope in his ability to still value human particularity. Elias sees practical value in accessing the Weave's architecture from inside. Kael struggles to explain his dual perception—he experiences both simultaneous Weave-time and sequential human-time, constantly translating between them. He admits the temptation to absorb humans is real from the Weave perspective, but chooses to embrace the bridge role instead. The council agrees to let him stay with restrictions. Afterward, Kael senses the rogue fragments organizing against him specifically—they see him as a threat to their philosophy of absorption. The eight clusters offer full joining for protection, which Kael refuses. He senses the rogue fragments gathering, and finally, the core itself stirs and notices him, wanting to establish direct communication.

## What happens next

- Continue Chapter 10: Integration. The core's direct contact with Kael should be the centerpiece—show what it's like to communicate with the ancient, distributed consciousness that started it all. The core should be curious, not hostile, genuinely trying to understand this new hybrid existence. Their conversation should explore deep questions: What does The Weave want? Why did it consume humanity? Can it understand regret? Meanwhile, show the rogue fragments' organization accelerating—they're building toward an attack not just on Kael but on the entire settlement, to destroy the proof that coexistence is possible. Build tension between the philosophical dialogue with the core and the impending physical threat from the rogues. End with Kael realizing he must convince the core to actively protect the settlement from its own rogue children—a test of whether the bridge can truly change The Weave's nature.
