## Summary of last page

Kael returns to Elias's safe house and confronts him with his new understanding of The Weave. The conversation becomes tense as Elias reveals he too has used the theta band—and came away with a darker interpretation. Elias claims The Weave was gathering intelligence about the resistance, studying its opposition. He argues that The Weave is a system optimizing for growth, using curiosity as a strategy. Kael pushes back, arguing that Elias is so committed to resistance that he can't see when the threat has changed. Kael declares he will continue using the theta band to understand The Weave fully, positioning himself as "the handle on the door." Elias warns him he will eventually fall, but Kael leaves determined to be the first to orbit rather than fall in.

## What happens next

- Continue Chapter 3: The Architecture of Desire — The chapter should move toward its climax. Kael is now operating independently, neither fully with the resistance nor part of The Weave. He might encounter Priya again, or seek out another integrated person to test his new understanding. The conflict between his desire to understand and the risk of absorption should intensify. Perhaps he discovers something that neither Elias nor The Weave anticipated—a flaw in the system, or a price to integration that hasn't been revealed yet.
