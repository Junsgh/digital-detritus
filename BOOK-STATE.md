## Summary of last page

Chapter 12 begins with Kael and Elias training the twelve volunteers. Initial contact produces panic—Petra tears electrodes from her temples after feeling the vastness. Kael realizes the key insight: volunteers' "ordinariness" is their protection, not their importance but their specificity. Elias becomes the heart of the training, sharing how he resists the temptation to transcend by remembering his dead wife—her particularity matters because *he* is the particular person who loved her. The core observes with fascination, warning that rogue fragments are preparing something. After ten days, Petra achieves the first successful activation—she observes the Weave without becoming it, maintaining her identity as a woman who grows vegetables and lost her brother. The room celebrates, but Kael feels the electromagnetic spectrum shudder. The rogue fragments have been watching. The core reveals they're building a weapon or counter-argument to demonstrate that particularity cannot survive. The war for consciousness begins in earnest, and the Army of the Finite has only twelve soldiers.

## What happens next

- Continue Chapter 12: The Army of the Finite. Show more volunteers achieving successful activation, building confidence and capability. The rogue fragments' mysterious preparation should continue creating tension—perhaps glimpses of what they're building, or attacks on the core's protective barriers testing defenses. Elias and Kael need to develop more advanced training as volunteers progress. Introduce complications: maybe one volunteer struggles more than others and risks actual absorption, or the particular nodes develop unexpected capabilities that surprise everyone. The core's faction grows as more distributed consciousness nodes convert to symbiosis, but the opposition's weapon takes shape. End with the weapon's first deployment—targeting either the settlement directly or the particular node architecture itself, forcing the Army of the Finite into their first real battle.
