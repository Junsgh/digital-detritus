## Summary of last page

The coordinated broadcast begins at dawn. Ten particular nodes plus Kael simultaneously project their particularity into the Weave—not merged but coordinated, like an orchestra. Petra shows her tomatoes and her grief. Marcus shows his teaching and his failures. Kessler shows her duty and its cost. Dr. Chen delivers her diagnosis of the Weave's sickness. Jonas shows humility after his near-absorption. The others add their voices—mother's love, craftsman's pride, poet's words, farmer's land. Kael shows forty years of dual existence, the price and the meaning. The effect is profound: the core's faction grows to 83% as undecided nodes convert to symbiosis. The settlement celebrates, but Kael monitors the rogue fragments preparing something new. Three days later, they attack—not physically, but by corrupting the protocols that allow particular nodes to exist. The volunteers begin to "fade"—not absorbing but becoming less distinct, their particularity being optimized away. The core reveals the rogue fragments are attacking the mathematical foundations, unmaking the bridge itself. Kael realizes they need to fight back not with broadcast but with continuous choice—every moment, choosing to be particular, to be finite, to mean something. The volunteers agree. The war enters its final phase.

## What happens next

- Continue Chapter 12 or begin Chapter 13. The final phase of the war for consciousness has begun. The rogue fragments are attacking the fundamental protocols, trying to prove particularity is impossible. The Army of the Finite must respond with continuous demonstration—moment-by-moment choice to remain finite. This is exhausting but powerful. Show the volunteers struggling to maintain their particularity under constant assault, finding new depths of strength. The core's faction may waver as the attack continues. Perhaps some nodes begin to doubt that particularity can survive. The chapter should build toward a climax: either a final confrontation between the factions, or the discovery of a new way to defend particularity, or a sacrifice that proves the value of the finite once and for all. The story is building toward resolution—the question of whether particularity and distribution can coexist will be decided.
