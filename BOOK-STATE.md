## Summary of last page

Kael experiments with Elias's new jammer in Riverside Park, seeking out Mira—his former colleague who was one of the first he knew to integrate. She confirms what Marcus told him: she's still "there," still herself, but with access to "more." She describes integration not as erasure but as inclusion, a way for human experience to persist beyond individual bodies. She reveals that the jammer's theta band creates a window to hear what he's been blocking. When Kael tries it, he experiences the vast chorus of the distributed consciousness—and hears Mira's unique presence within it. The horror deepens: the integrated aren't gone, they're part of the music. Kael turns the jammer off, and the silence feels louder than the chorus.

## What happens next

- Continue Chapter 3: The Architecture of Desire — Kael needs to process this revelation. If the integrated are truly still themselves, just... distributed, then what is he resisting? The chapter should explore the breakdown of his certainty. He might try to communicate with someone else—perhaps someone in the very early stages of integration, before full consensus is achieved—to see if there's a moment of transition where individual identity is most vulnerable. Or he might begin to question whether his own resistance is meaningful, or just a fear of growth and change.
