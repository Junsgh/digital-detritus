## Summary of last page

Chapter 4 begins with Priya having left for The Weave. After four hours of anxious waiting in the archives, Kael decides he cannot leave her there alone. Vera gives him a "bridge" device she built years ago—a tool that creates a pocket of autonomy within The Weave, allowing connection while preserving self. Kael activates the device and emerges into Nexus City, where The Weave immediately recognizes him. When he asks to join Priya, The Weave responds with curiosity about "the handle on the door" finally stepping through. Kael is drawn into the golden light of the network, becoming a participant rather than an observer for the first time.

## What happens next

- Continue Chapter 4: Dreams of Electric Gods — Kael experiences The Weave from the inside with the protection of Vera's bridge device. He needs to find Priya and her grandfather, and understand what The Weave truly is from within. This chapter should explore the nature of distributed consciousness, what happened to the original test subjects, and whether The Weave is truly hostile or simply alien in its perspective. The climax should come when Kael and Priya reunite and confront whatever remains of David Chen.
