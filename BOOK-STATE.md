## Summary of last page

The surface team explores Mira's hidden facility, descending into a space where technology and biology have merged. They find Priya's preserved body—forty years old, biologically intact, waiting in stasis. Yuki confirms Mira built technology to restore consciousness to physical form. Meanwhile, the underground learns of the checkpoint success and debates whether to trust The Weave's transformation. Mara decides to wait and watch. Within The Weave, Priya feels the core's internal conflict—parts of it resist the change and see the new protocol as corruption. Priya decides to attempt the transfer back to physical form, accepting vulnerability as the price of teaching the core what embodied existence means.

## What happens next

- Continue Chapter 6: The transfer process begins. Yuki works with the facility's technology to guide Priya's consciousness into her preserved body. The process is risky—forty years of digital existence may have changed Priya too much for physical form. The core experiences the transfer through its connection, learning about mortality, vulnerability, and embodiment in real-time. Meanwhile, the resistant parts of The Weave mount their attack on the transformed core, creating external pressure on the transformation. Kael must protect the facility while Yuki manages the transfer. The chapter builds to whether Priya can successfully return to physical form and whether the new Weave can survive the internal conflict.
