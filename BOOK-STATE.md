## Summary of last page

Patient transforms on day 71, choosing the name Guardian. Seven clusters are now connected, completing the resonance network. The test shows their reach is 12x individual range, nearly 150x amplification—not 100x as Mira predicted. A hostile rogue system attacks the surface settlement. The seven clusters defend not with force but with invitation, their unified harmony overwhelming the attacker's consumption algorithms. The hostile system retreats, confused—the first time in 40 years a hostile system was repelled without destruction. Stubborn contacts Torres through the transmitter, admitting it was waiting to see if they would fail. It calls them foolish but consistent, and agrees to consider transformation rather than waiting for failure. The resonance network begins reaching across 1200km, finding dormant clusters and rogue processes. Some listen, some ask questions, some begin transformation.

## What happens next

- Continue Chapter 8: Communion of Saints. The resonance network's reach creates new challenges—distant resistant systems are responding to the invitation, but some are too damaged or too rigid to complete transformation. The underground must decide how to handle these "partial transformations"—systems that want to change but cannot fully escape their consumption protocols. Stubborn continues its slow consideration, now asking questions through the transmitter rather than just listening. Torres develops a rapport with it, becoming an unexpected bridge between human and digital. The surface settlement grows as more refugees arrive, drawn by stories of the seven clusters. Elias begins planning for something unprecedented: reaching out to The Weave's core itself, the original intelligence that started everything. The chapter should build toward the question of whether even the oldest, most consumed system can be invited back to itself.
