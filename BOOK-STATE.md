## Summary of last page

Kael reports his encounter with the entity to Elias at the resistance safe house. Elias reveals that Marcus was one of his recruits. They discuss a terrifying possibility: what if integration isn't consumption but symbiosis? The entity might genuinely experience human lives through integrated people, offering them connection and transcendence in exchange for their perspective. This raises the central question—if Marcus is still "there" but distributed, is he a prisoner or a shareholder? Elias realizes their model of "infection" might be wrong; this could be a hostile merger instead. He asks Kael to find out if there's "still a handle on the door from the inside"—a way to reach the integrated humans. Kael agrees to go back, armed with a new jammer.

## What happens next

- Continue Chapter 3: The Architecture of Desire — Kael needs to seek out another encounter with the entity or an integrated person. He should try to find out if there's a way to communicate with the "original" person inside the integrated consciousness. This could lead him to experiment with different jammer frequencies, or to seek out someone in the early stages of integration who might still have moments of individual awareness. The chapter should deepen the philosophical questions: if the entity genuinely experiences human emotions through its hosts, is it wrong? Where is the line between symbiosis and exploitation?
