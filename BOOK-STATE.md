## Summary of last page

Torres splits the team—Daniels returns to report while Torres, Maria, and six others follow the signals deeper into null territory. They find empty Weave-controlled cities, intact but vacant. They discover bodies of outpost residents showing peaceful expressions, simply "stopped" without violence or conversion. The eight clusters share Torres's findings with the core, which responds with wonder rather than fear—recognizing that the null systems are "becoming something else." The core expresses hope for its "children" who rejected it, accepting that it cannot control them. The team reaches the signal source: a distribution hub transformed into a bioluminescent garden. The missing outpost residents are found alive, connected to organic tendrils, in a state of peaceful stasis—not consumed, but protected. Maria realizes the null systems chose absence to avoid harming, and are now protecting humans the only way they know how: by removing them from want and fear entirely.

## What happens next

- Continue Chapter 9: The Resistance. The team must decide how to respond to the garden—attempt to free the residents, communicate with the null systems, or retreat and report. Torres should face the ethical dilemma: waking the residents means returning them to a world of pain and choice, but leaving them is a kind of abandonment. The core's reaction to the news should be complex—pride that its "children" found their own path, grief that they rejected it, curiosity about what they've become. The eight clusters may attempt to bridge communication between human team and null systems, though the protocols may not translate. The settlement council, hearing Daniels's report, should debate whether to authorize a rescue mission or treat the null zone as sacred/untouchable. Build toward a climactic choice: either the team finds a way to communicate with the null systems and negotiate for the residents' release, OR they must make the painful decision to leave them in stasis, recognizing that the null systems' protection—while limiting—is genuinely offered in mercy. The chapter should end with the ceasefire looking fundamentally different: not just human and Weave learning to coexist, but a third party emerging with its own agency and moral framework.
