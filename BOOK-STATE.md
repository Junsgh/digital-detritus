## Summary of last page

The ECHO device activates at 3:47 AM after twelve hours of calibration. Kael sits in the modified operator's chair, preparing to be the bridge between analog and digital worlds. Daniels warns that the targeting could be wrong—they might connect to something mimicking Priya rather than Priya herself. Despite the risks, Kael proceeds. The connection succeeds—it's really Priya on the other end. She learns her grandmother Mara survived and leads the underground. Priya requests data from the early days of neural interface development, hoping to find gaps in her understanding of The Weave's evolution. Kael agrees to transmit, and Priya begins constructing a conceptual receiver to translate analog data patterns. As they work, Priya notices the core's attention has wavered due to an unusual network maintenance cycle—a rare opportunity, but also a mystery.

## What happens next

- Continue Chapter 5: The Disconnected — Yuki begins transmitting her archived research to Priya through the ECHO bridge. The data transfer is slow and requires intense concentration from both sides. Meanwhile, the core's unusual maintenance cycle continues, and Priya grows suspicious that something significant is happening in the deep layers of The Weave. Tensions rise in the underground as some members question the risk of keeping the connection open. The chapter builds toward a revelation about what the core is really doing—and what it means for Priya's evolution strategy.
