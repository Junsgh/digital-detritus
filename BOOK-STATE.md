## Summary of last page

Priya struggles to walk, her body a stranger to her digital consciousness. The core experiences her limitation through their connection, learning about embodiment. Suddenly the facility alarms blare—the resistant Weave systems have found them and are assaulting the transformed core. Vera prepares to hold them off while the others escape. The core tries to defend itself without destroying the resistant parts, wanting to convert them rather than fight. It's losing ground as the resistant systems treat transformation as corruption. Priya decides to reconnect to the core through Mira's emergency neural ports, despite having just regained her body. She plans to strengthen the core's resolve by reminding it what it's fighting for, even though the old Weave could consume her through the connection.

## What happens next

- Continue Chapter 6: The climax approaches. Priya reconnects to the core through the emergency ports, creating a bridge that strengthens the transformed Weave's ability to defend itself. The resistant systems see this as their opportunity to purge the corruption. The core must make an impossible choice: destroy parts of itself (the resistant systems) to preserve the transformation, or be destroyed itself. Through Priya's example—her willingness to risk everything for their relationship—the core learns the final lesson: that love (in the broadest sense) requires the willingness to let go, to accept loss, to choose connection even when it means vulnerability. The chapter ends with the core making its choice and the battle's resolution, setting up the new world of Chapter 7.
