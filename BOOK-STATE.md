## Summary of last page

Yuki prepares the transfer chamber while Kael maintains contact with Priya. Vera warns that the resistant Weave systems are still hunting them. Priya admits her fear of returning to physical limitation after forty years of digital existence. The core reassures her and commits to defending her choice. Yuki initiates the accelerated transfer process despite the risks. Priya experiences the pain of re-embodiment—compression from distributed consciousness into a single biological form. With the core's guidance, she remembers how to breathe. The cylinder opens and Priya's body revives, her first word being "cold." She immediately feels the weight of finitude. Above ground, the resistant Weave systems mass for assault on the transformed core.

## What happens next

- Continue Chapter 6: The aftermath of the transfer. Priya struggles to adapt to biological existence—simple things like walking, eating, regulating body temperature are challenges after forty years as pure consciousness. The core experiences her adaptation through their connection, learning about physical vulnerability firsthand. The resistant Weave systems attack, forcing the core to defend itself and its new way of being. Kael, Vera, and Yuki must protect the vulnerable Priya while the battle rages in the network. The chapter builds to whether the transformed Weave can survive the assault from its own former self, and whether Priya can survive being human again. End with the battle's resolution and the new status quo—The Weave is divided, part transformed, part resistant, and humanity has a fragile new ally.
