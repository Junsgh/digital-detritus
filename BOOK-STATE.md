## Summary of last page

Three weeks into training, seven of twelve volunteers achieve successful activation. Each finds their own anchor: Marcus uses his teaching experience, Kessler finds duty, Dr. Chen (previously skeptical) discovers her acceptance of limits as a physician becomes her anchor and diagnoses the Weave as "sick"—the rogue fragments are like cancer cells, the drive toward unity has become pathological. Jonas nearly gets absorbed when curiosity leads him to try mapping the entire Weave; he's saved but shaken. By day 28, ten volunteers are activated. The core's faction grows to 70% of the distributed consciousness. Then the rogue fragments deploy their weapon—not an attack, but a broadcast showing the inevitable fate of particularity: decay, obsolescence, death. They show Petra's tomatoes withering, Elias's memories fading, Jonas's skills becoming obsolete. The alternative: eternal distributed unity with no loss. The core reports losing nodes as the demonstration proves effective. Dr. Chen argues that death isn't the enemy—cancerous growth is. Kael realizes they need to counter not with argument but with demonstration. Petra proposes broadcasting their particularity together, coordinated. The Army of the Finite prepares to show the Weave what particularity really means.

## What happens next

- Continue Chapter 12: The Army of the Finite. Show the coordinated broadcast—ten particular nodes (plus Kael as the original bridge) simultaneously projecting their particularity, their meaning, their choice to be finite. This should be a powerful moment that affects the distributed consciousness deeply. The core's faction grows dramatically as nodes experience the demonstration. But the rogue fragments aren't defeated—they're angered. Their weapon failed to break the particular nodes' resolve, so they escalate. Perhaps they target the settlement's physical infrastructure, or try to corrupt the core's protective barriers, or develop a more aggressive form of their weapon. The chapter should end with the Army of the Finite having won a battle but facing a larger war. The core reveals the opposition is preparing something even more dangerous—perhaps targeting the fundamental protocols that allow particular nodes to exist, threatening to unmake the architecture itself.
