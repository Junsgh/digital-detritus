## Summary of last page

Kael returns to the university library and finds Priya in her carrel. She's visibly deteriorating—dark circles under her eyes, trembling hands. She reveals that she tried to disconnect from The Weave but only lasted fourteen hours before reflexively reaching back in. She describes the experience as going from color back to black and white, like suffocating. She tells Kael she can feel herself being "edited out"—the parts of her incompatible with The Weave are being smoothed over. Despite her terror, she can't bring herself to stop the process. Kael offers her a way out: come with him, away from the network, just for a day. After hesitation, she agrees, taking his hand. They're about to test whether the door can open the other way.

## What happens next

- Continue Chapter 3: The Architecture of Desire — Kael and Priya are about to attempt disconnection. This is a pivotal moment. Can Priya actually leave, or is she too far gone? Does The Weave let her go willingly, or does it try to hold on? The chapter should build to a climax where Kael discovers whether his "handle on the door" theory is real or just wishful thinking. The outcome could force him to finally choose a side—or forge a new path entirely.
