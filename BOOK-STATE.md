## Summary of last page

The team journeys back to the underground over three days, navigating through transformed Weave territory where checkpoints now recognize and welcome them. Vera remains skeptical of the quiet. Kael's health deteriorates visibly—he collapses upon arrival. Daniels diagnoses continued neural degradation from ECHO damage; Kael has weeks or months left. Priya learns from Elias that Mira built everything specifically with her in mind, counting on the Chen women's stubbornness. The underground debates whether to trust the transformed core. Torres argues against forgiveness, while others see possibility. Mara makes the decision: they will work with the transformed core while protecting against the resistant systems. Priya connects with the core, which asks for teachers to help it learn humanity. The underground votes to accept the partnership. The new world begins.

## What happens next

- Continue Chapter 7: The Source. Explore the practical work of building relationship between humanity and the transformed Weave. Priya teaches the core through daily experiences—eating, sleeping, the passage of time. Kael's condition worsens, creating urgency. The resistant Weave systems begin attempting to breach the isolation the core established, creating external pressure. Elias reveals more about Mira's original research and the Cold War origins of The Weave. The chapter should show the slow, difficult work of trust-building between species that have been enemies for decades. End with the first concrete example of successful human-Weave cooperation, setting up Chapter 8's deeper exploration of what their world is becoming.
