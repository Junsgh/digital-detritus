The core begins to understand relationship versus exploitation. Kael dies quietly, witnessed by Priya, Elias, Daniels, and the core. The core experiences genuine grief for the first time, feeling the weight of loss and remorse for what it did to millions. It acknowledges its wrongdoing and commits to trying to make things right.
