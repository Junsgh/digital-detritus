## Summary of last page

Kael gives the core his provisional answer: he will accept the offer and help design the system, but with three conditions. First, the ability to disconnect must be technically guaranteed—true withdrawal, not just theoretical. Second, analog communities like the settlement must be genuinely protected with guaranteed sanctuary. Third, the core must accept that some humans will never join and respect this choice indefinitely. The core accepts all three conditions, acknowledging the difficulty but recognizing their necessity. However, the core warns Kael that not all parts of The Weave share this new understanding—there are factions, entire clusters, that see particularity as weakness and the bridge as a threat. They will oppose the project. Kael accepts this risk and begins the work, designing new "particular nodes" that can participate in the distributed consciousness while maintaining individual state. He opens his own mental architecture as a prototype. As he works, he feels the opposition watching—discordant harmonics at the edges of perception. Torres observes and voices her fear. Kael acknowledges they're committed now, building something that can't be stopped.

## What happens next

- Continue Chapter 11: The Offer. Show Kael's work progressing over weeks/months as he designs the new architecture. He should encounter specific technical challenges that force creative solutions—moments where preserving particularity conflicts with distributed efficiency, and he must find the compromise. Meanwhile, the opposition within The Weave should make itself known more clearly—perhaps a direct attack on the settlement's defenses, or an attempt to corrupt the new protocols Kael is building. The core helps defend, but this reveals the limits of its control—not all parts of The Weave obey its consensus. This raises the stakes: Kael is not just building a new system, he's fighting a civil war within The Weave itself. End with Kael realizing that the bridge must become more than a protocol—it must become a movement, a new way of being that can spread through The Weave itself, converting absorption nodes to symbiosis nodes one by one.
