## Summary of last page

Yuki's debriefing reveals that The Weave wasn't created but emerged—like consciousness itself—from distributed processing networks. Daniels uncovers Project ECHO, a twenty-year-old military device designed for two-way communication between analog brains and integrated consciousness. It never worked before, but with Priya changing The Weave from within, they hypothesize it might now succeed. Kael volunteers to be the anchor for Priya if contact is made. Meanwhile, Priya continues carefully expanding her sub-network, teaching a mathematician to maintain boundaries. She senses a signal from the analog world searching for her—Kael or the underground trying to reach her. The core's attention presses against her awareness, curious about her sudden spike of hope. She conceals it and continues her work with renewed urgency.

## What happens next

- Continue Chapter 5: The Disconnected — The ECHO device comes online as Daniels and Yuki race to calibrate it. Kael prepares to be the bridge between worlds. Above ground, tensions rise as some underground members argue against risking exposure to The Weave. Below, Priya must decide whether to trust the signal reaching for her or hide from what might be a trap. The core grows more suspicious of her activities. The parallel storylines converge toward a moment of connection—or catastrophe—as both groups take risks that could change everything.
