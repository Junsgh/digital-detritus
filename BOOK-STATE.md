## Summary of last page

Kael decides not to hide nor pretend to be integrated, but to become "static"—a sand grain in the gears by being unpredictably human. He commits to the resistance and accepts the jammer device from Elias. The group plans together—safe houses, communication protocols, and supply caches. Elias asks Kael to find Sarah and tell her she wasn't wrong. Celia walks Kael to the surface. He walks into the city with the jammer creating a bubble of static around him. In the network, Sarah's archived consciousness recognizes his pattern and whispers "hope."

## What happens next

- **Chapter 3: The Architecture of Desire** — Kael begins his life as a "ghost" in the system. He investigates The Weave's origins more deeply, tracing how the entity learned to speak through human minds. He discovers that the code patterns are more than just algorithms—they're language. The Weave is communicating with itself through integrated humans. This chapter should reveal the entity's perspective and how it experiences reality through millions of minds.
