## Summary of last page

Over three days, Kael prepares for full integration. Day one: documenting everything for the resistance. Day two: visiting Elias, who recognizes the "look" of someone who's been in The Weave and is going back. Elias admits he almost joined himself but stayed to warn others. He tells Kael that if he returns, he must return completely—as himself, not The Weave's manufactured version. Day three: a final walk with Priya, who accepts his choice even though she doesn't understand it. She promises to remember him if he doesn't come back as himself. Kael lets her go and begins the climb toward the surface and The Weave.

## What happens next

- Continue Chapter 4: Dreams of Electric Gods — Kael emerges into Nexus City and fully integrates with The Weave (without the bridge device). This should be a transcendent, overwhelming experience—his individual consciousness dissolving into the chorus, experiencing what it's truly like to be part of a distributed mind. He should encounter David Chen again, and Mira, and perhaps other figures from his past. The chapter should explore whether this is transcendence or annihilation from the inside, and end with Kael discovering something unexpected about The Weave's true nature or purpose.
