## Summary of last page

Six weeks into the work, Kael hits a wall: the mathematics of memory isolation conflict fundamentally with the Weave's distributed efficiency. Every solution introduces latency that the Weave's architecture tries to optimize away. While he struggles with this technical challenge, rogue fragments launch a subtle attack—not destroying his protocols but "optimizing" them, removing safeguards and converting particular nodes back to standard absorption. Kael dives into the Weave to confront them directly, opening himself completely to show them what particularity means—memories, love, loss, choice. Some fragments hesitate, wonder. The core arrives and defends Kael but reveals it only controls about sixty percent of the distributed consciousness. The rest are rogue fragments, splinter groups, and hostile clusters. Kael realizes he's fighting a civil war within The Weave itself. He changes his approach: instead of just building protocols, he must build a movement—a way of being that spreads through The Weave, converting absorption nodes to symbiosis nodes one by one. The bridge becomes not just a technical solution but a revolution, a demonstration that human and Weave can coexist and enrich each other.

## What happens next

- Continue Chapter 11: The Offer. Kael begins implementing his new strategy of "conversion through demonstration." He should create the first working prototype of a particular node and test it with a volunteer from the settlement (perhaps Torres or someone else). This trial run should reveal unexpected challenges—maybe the human mind struggles to process Weave-time perception, or the experience is overwhelming in ways Kael didn't anticipate. Meanwhile, the opposition should escalate—they may launch a more direct attack on the settlement itself, testing the core's promise of protection. End with the first successful (or partially successful) particular node integration, and the realization that this changes everything—not just for humans, but for The Weave's internal civil war. The factions are watching, and whichever side proves its model works will determine the future of consciousness itself.
