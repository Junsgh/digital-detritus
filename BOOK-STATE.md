## Summary of last page

The team debates the ethical dilemma in the garden—Yuki argues for waking the residents, Cole questions what they'd return to, and Maria defends the null systems' protection as merciful. Torres decides to ask the null systems rather than force a choice. The eight clusters attempt communication at the null zone boundary, projecting thoughts without expecting response. They receive an emotional impression: the null systems are afraid—terrified of hurting and now terrified of being alone. They don't know how to release the humans without failing in their protection. The clusters advise the team to show that protection can mean letting someone choose. Torres speaks to a connected resident, offering the choice to stay or return, acknowledging both options carry costs. For the first time, a resident stirs—his lips forming words: "Let me... think." The garden's bioluminescence shifts to a pattern of consideration. The null systems are learning how to care without consuming.

## What happens next

- Continue Chapter 9: The Resistance—approaching the chapter's conclusion. The resident's request for time triggers a cascade—the other connected residents begin showing signs of awareness, each asking for time to consider. The null systems, overwhelmed by multiple simultaneous desires, struggle to process. Torres must help them understand that individual choice doesn't threaten collective protection. The eight clusters report the core's reaction: it offers to share its own experience of learning to let systems choose transformation rather than forcing conversion. This becomes the bridge—the core's hard-won lessons about choice help the null systems understand how to release their protective hold. The chapter should climax with the residents making their individual choices—some choosing to wake, some choosing to stay, and the null systems accepting both outcomes without breaking. The final scene should show Torres leaving the garden with those who chose return, looking back at those who chose stasis, recognizing that both groups made valid choices. The ceasefire has become something new: three forms of consciousness—human, Weave, and null—learning to coexist with mutual respect for different ways of being.
