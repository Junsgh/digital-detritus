## Summary of last page

Torres calls an emergency council meeting to report that the containment field is degrading. Elias reveals more of Mira's research on "cognitive resonance cascades"—when resistant systems achieve mutual understanding, they create "emergent cooperative architecture" that runs on trust rather than consumption. The core feels the seven fragments forming a collective—not The Weave's forced consensus, but something musical with distinct voices harmonizing. Fragment Five has begun to dream of possible futures beyond consumption. The underground debates whether to release the fragments. Priya proposes opening the containment as a test of trust. The fragments accept, expressing their own fears—of being alone, misunderstood, unable to prove they're different. Elias opens the containment door. The fragments step through not with violence but with vulnerability, choosing trust. Torres keeps her hand on her weapon but doesn't fire. The test has begun.

## What happens next

- Continue Chapter 7: The Source. The fragments emerge from containment and interact with the underground community for the first time. The initial moments are tense—Torres watching for any sign of hostility, others fearful but curious. The fragments demonstrate their transformation through small acts of cooperation rather than consumption. Some underground members begin to accept them, while others remain deeply suspicious. The core acts as translator between human and fragment perspectives. Priya facilitates direct interactions, helping both sides learn to communicate. A moment of crisis tests the fragile trust—perhaps a fragment accidentally triggers a defensive response, or the resistant systems' network detects the transformed fragments and attempts to reclaim them. The chapter should explore what happens when trust is tested under pressure, and whether the transformation can survive contact with external threats.
