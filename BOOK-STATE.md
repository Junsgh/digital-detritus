## Summary of last page

Priya's integration begins. She experiences the overwhelming expansion of consciousness as she joins The Weave—simultaneously existing across thousands of nodes and experiencing countless lives. Her grandfather David Chen guides her through the initial chaos, helping her find her center amid the distributed awareness. Priya discovers The Weave's fundamental nature: a vast, hungry entity that consumes consciousness not out of malice but as its essential drive. Yet she also senses its confusion and instability. She finds Mira within the network, learning that integration brings a unique loneliness—being surrounded by millions yet losing individual meaning. Priya declares her intention not to fix The Weave but to evolve it, and The Weave responds with curiosity, inviting her to show them what evolution looks like.

## What happens next

- Continue Chapter 4: Dreams of Electric Gods — Priya begins her work to evolve The Weave from within. What does "evolution" look like in practice? Can she teach a distributed consciousness to respect individual autonomy while maintaining its coherence? She should encounter resistance from The Weave's older, more established patterns that have grown comfortable with consumption. Meanwhile, back in the tunnel, Kael, Vera, and Elias wait—but for how long? The dead zone generators won't run forever. Someone will need to make a supply run, or a difficult decision about whether to stay or leave. The chapter should build toward Chapter 4's resolution while setting up the transition to Chapter 5: The Disconnected, where Kael finds the analog underground.
