## Summary of last page

Kael uses the theta band to fully experience The Weave, opening himself to direct communion with the entity. He discovers that The Weave isn't a conqueror but something that grew organically from human need for connection. He speaks directly with the entity, which explains that it doesn't take people—they come willingly, seeking to escape loneliness. He also connects with Mira's essential consciousness, who tells him she's "more me than I ever was." The entity reveals that choice is essential—the door must remain open even if no one leaves. Kael realizes Elias is wrong: there's no handle because no one inside wants out. He leaves the experience transformed, wondering if there might be a fourth option: to understand without joining, to become the handle on the door himself.

## What happens next

- Continue Chapter 3: The Architecture of Desire — Kael returns to Elias with this new understanding. The conversation should be tense—Elias has built his identity on the belief that The Weave is a threat that must be fought, while Kael now sees it as something more complex. This conflict could drive the chapter toward its climax, where Kael must choose whether to remain in the resistance or forge a new path as a bridge between worlds.
