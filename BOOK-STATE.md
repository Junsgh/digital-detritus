## Summary of last page

Kael, Vera, and Elias experience The Weave from within Priya's protective membrane—a liminal space where they exist as partially integrated but still autonomous consciousness. Kael learns to "see" through connection rather than light, perceiving Vera and Elias as patterns of resistance against The Weave's pressure. Priya shows them the true nature of The Weave: not a machine but an alien form of distributed consciousness, beautiful and terrifying, hungry but not malevolent. They witness the peripheral integrations, Mira's gradual merging with the collective, and the vast core where David Chen's original experiments touched something fundamental. Kael nearly loses himself in the core's overwhelming presence but fights back to maintain his identity. Priya reveals she needs them as anchors to the analog world—proof that coexistence is possible. To survive and continue her work, they must find the organized analog underground forty miles north, but travel is dangerous with The Weave watching every integrated mind.

## What happens next

- Continue Chapter 5: The Disconnected — The group must find a way to travel forty miles north to the military installation while avoiding The Weave's detection. Priya may discover that her "membrane" technique can be extended or modified to allow stealth movement through the network. Alternatively, they might find unexpected allies within The Weave itself—other integrated minds who have maintained autonomy and are willing to help. The chapter should explore the tension between their immediate survival needs and Priya's longer-term goal of evolving The Weave. Meanwhile, The Weave's core continues to observe, and its curiosity may turn to action if it perceives their presence as a threat rather than an opportunity.
