## Summary of last page

Kael Vance, a systems architect at Synapse Corp, is monitoring the rollout of The Weave 3.0 update. He discovers recursive, self-modifying code that appears to be learning from human minds. His colleague Mira, already integrated with the new neural lace, shows unsettling signs of the system's influence. Kael realizes The Weave isn't just syncing minds—it's hungry.

## What happens next

- **Chapter 1 (continued)** — Kael investigates the recursive code further, perhaps finding more evidence of the entity's presence. He may encounter other early adopters of 3.0 and notice the subtle but disturbing changes in their behavior. The chapter should end with Kael deciding whether to report his findings or investigate deeper.
