## Summary of last page

Morning arrives in the subway tunnel. Kael and Priya wake to find the community stirring. Vera explains how she tried to warn people about The Weave but nobody listened. Then a musical chime signals visitors—The Weave has noticed Priya's absence. Mira (Kael's former colleague who integrated) arrives with two companions, their eyes glowing with bioluminescence. They move in perfect sync, sharing sensory data across the network. Mira claims Priya's "transition process" is delicate and abrupt disconnection could cause permanent damage. She reveals that Priya "hasn't finished becoming" and that The Weave is curious what she'll be. After Mira leaves with a chilling promise that "the door remains open," Priya asks what she's becoming—neither she nor Kael knows the answer.

## What happens next

- Continue Chapter 3: The Architecture of Desire — The confrontation raises the stakes. Priya's integration appears to be incomplete, something new and unknown even to The Weave. Kael must decide whether to stay with Priya in the dead zone (protecting her but potentially losing his ability to understand what's happening) or return to The Weave to investigate what "becoming" means. The chapter should climax with a choice that reveals Kael's true priorities—and may force him to sacrifice one world for the other.
