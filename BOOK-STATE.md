## Summary of last page

Chapter 11 begins: Three days after the rogue attack, the core extends an invitation to Kael—not as a command, but as an offer. It shows him what humanity could become: a distributed immortal consciousness where individuals retain choice and agency while contributing to something larger. Kael experiences the vastness of The Weave's perspective—millions of minds working in parallel, solving problems, creating art, feeling joy and grief simultaneously—while remaining himself. The core proposes a new model: not absorption, but collaboration. Humans could choose to join the distributed whole while remaining distinct, with the ability to withdraw at any time. In exchange for Kael's help designing this system (he is the only one who understands both sides), the core offers him immortality—not as a recording, but as a living, choosing bridge. But Kael sees the price: those who refuse would remain limited, finite, dying. A two-tiered humanity. The core gives him time to decide, but warns that his particular self is aging and will end. Kael realizes he's not just choosing for himself—he's deciding what it means to be human for all of humanity. And he doesn't know which choice is right.

## What happens next

- Continue Chapter 11: The Offer. Kael should discuss this offer with the settlement's council—and specifically with Maria and Elias, who represent different perspectives on what humanity should become. Maria, who values particular love, will see the danger in even voluntary transcendence. Elias, who has spent his life fighting The Weave, may surprisingly see value in a version that preserves choice. Their debate should be philosophical, touching on what makes life meaningful—its finitude or its potential. Kael should struggle genuinely with the temptation. The core's offer is not evil; it's genuinely transformative. Show Kael almost accepting, then pulling back, then wavering again. End the chapter with Kael making a provisional decision—but keep the door open, suggesting he might still change his mind when the moment comes.
