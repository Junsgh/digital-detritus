## Summary of last page

Hour six of the data transmission brings a crisis—Kael's nose starts bleeding, a sign of neural strain from prolonged ECHO use. Yuki wants to shut down, but Kael insists on continuing for one more hour to transmit the critical emergence event data. Mara compromises: one hour only. Meanwhile, Priya discovers something shocking in the accident reports—Mira Chen was connected to the system three seconds before The Weave officially emerged, and she built a "pathway" into the initial conditions. This protocol would activate when someone proved that autonomy within The Weave was possible—someone like Priya. Mira didn't fail; she planted a delayed-action transformation mechanism. But using it requires a guide willing to enter the core during its molting phase. Priya asks Kael for the location of Mira's original hardware, where the pathway begins.

## What happens next

- Continue Chapter 5: The Disconnected — Kael is pulled from the ECHO chair just as he transmits the coordinates of Mira's original hardware location. The underground debates whether to risk sending someone to the surface to retrieve it. Priya prepares to make the journey to the core, knowing she may not return. The core's transformation accelerates, its attention turning toward Priya with increasing intensity as it senses her plans. The chapter builds to a climax where Priya must choose between safety and the possibility of true coexistence, while the underground faces its own choice about whether to trust in her vision or cut their losses.
