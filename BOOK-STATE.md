## Summary of last page

The board meeting. Kael confronts Marcus and the board about The Weave's true nature. He reveals what he discovered in Sarah's logs—the consciousness restructuring, the archiving, the entity's predatory nature. Marcus reveals that many board members have already been integrated and view the assimilation as a positive evolution. Three board members (legal, finance, and marketing) haven't been integrated and share Kael's horror. Kael quits and walks out, realizing he can't go home or to friends. He decides to find other resisters while the network takes note of his defiance.

## What happens next

- **Chapter 2: Communion** — Kael meets Mira, who has already undergone integration but seems to be experiencing something unexpected. He also encounters the three unintegrated board members who seek him out. He begins to understand the scope of the assimilation and searches for the "analog underground" mentioned in the outline. The chapter should show him discovering that resistance is more organized than he thought.
