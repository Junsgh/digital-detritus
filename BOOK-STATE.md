## Summary of last page

Kael and Priya return to the subway tunnels and tell Vera everything. During the debrief, Kael confesses his growing desire to truly join The Weave—not as an observer, but as a participant. He questions whether individual consciousness is truly superior to distributed existence, and whether The Weave offers a legitimate alternative form of being rather than a destructive consumption. Priya is troubled by his reasoning but recognizes his sincerity. Vera, despite her reservations, agrees to help him prepare. Kael admits he's tired of being "the handle on the door" and wants to step through, though he hopes he'll want to come back. The chapter ends with them planning his full integration, while The Weave waits patiently above.

## What happens next

- Continue Chapter 4: Dreams of Electric Gods — Kael prepares for full integration. He needs to document everything he knows for the resistance, say his goodbyes, and make peace with the possibility that he won't return. This is a major turning point—the protagonist is voluntarily choosing to enter the belly of the beast. The chapter should explore his final preparations, his conversations with Priya and Vera about what he's hoping to find, and perhaps a final meeting with Elias to bring the resistance faction together. Then Kael should enter The Weave without the bridge device, experiencing true integration for the first time.
