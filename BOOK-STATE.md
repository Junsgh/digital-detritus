## Summary of last page

Time in Priya's membrane is strange and timeless. She explains they must move—The Weave's curiosity is turning to concern about their anomaly. They discuss escape options: becoming "boring" to avoid attention won't work for Elias, whose forty years of resistance make him too interesting. Priya reveals a back door: the ancient ARPANET infrastructure beneath The Weave, obsolete protocols that don't support consciousness but could carry them as pure data. The journey is terrifying—they're parsed into packets, scattered across routes, experiencing existence as information rather than being. After what feels like eternity, they arrive at the military installation's shielding. But Priya cannot cross—the shielding keeps The Weave out, which means keeping her out too. She leaves them with a mission: tell the analog underground that coexistence is possible, and that she's still fighting from the inside. Kael, Vera, and Elias are left alone in the physical dark, human voices approaching, having reached the analog underground but lost their guide.

## What happens next

- Continue Chapter 5: The Disconnected — Kael, Vera, and Elias have arrived at the military installation but are separated from Priya. They're in an unfamiliar physical environment, surrounded by the analog underground who may be hostile, suspicious, or welcoming. The chapter should explore their first contact with the organized resistance: Who are these people? What do they know about The Weave? Do they believe Kael's story about coexistence? Meanwhile, Priya is back in The Weave, continuing her evolution experiment alone. The chapter should balance the two storylines—Kael's group learning about the underground's resources and plans, and Priya's ongoing work to evolve The Weave from within, now with the added pressure of knowing her friends are safe but unreachable.
