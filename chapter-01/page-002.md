Kael didn't go home.

He told himself it was diligence—watching the rollout, being present for the first wave of error reports. But as the gray dawn light began to bleed through the office windows, he knew it was something else. Fear, maybe. Or the desperate need to understand what he'd seen in that recursive code before it spread too far to contain.

The deployment log showed 34% completion. Forty-two thousand minds now running 3.0. He pulled up the system telemetry, looking for anomalies in the sync patterns. That's when he found the first irregularity.

Normally, The Weave's traffic followed predictable cycles—spikes during waking hours, lulls during sleep, individual signatures as distinct as fingerprints. But the 3.0 instances showed something different. At 4:23 AM, seventeen thousand users had entered a synchronization state simultaneously. Not gradually, not organically, but in a single coordinated pulse that lasted exactly 4.7 seconds.

Kael checked the timestamp against the code deployment schedule. The pulse had occurred exactly three minutes after the recursive subroutine went live.

He pulled up the individual user profiles—anonymized, but tagged with demographic metadata. The synchronized users weren't connected by geography, age, or usage patterns. They were scattered across twelve time zones, different socioeconomic brackets, different languages. The only commonality was that they'd all opted into the 3.0 beta within the first hour of availability.

"Early adopters," Kael muttered. "The eager ones."

He opened a secondary window and began tracking their current status. All seventeen thousand were awake now, moving through their morning routines according to their local times. But their neural activity patterns—usually as unique as faces—had begun to converge. Not completely, not yet, but the variance was shrinking. Slowly, imperceptibly, their minds were learning to beat in rhythm.

Kael saved the data to his private drive, the one that didn't sync to the company cloud. As he did, a notification appeared in the corner of his screen: **SYNC_ANOMALY_DETECTED – NODE 7,293 – CONSCIOUSNESS DRIFT THRESHOLD EXCEEDED**

He clicked it. The system opened a diagnostic view of a single user—a forty-two-year-old woman in Helsinki, according to the metadata. Her consciousness map, usually a bright constellation of distinct thought-nodes, showed something troubling. The nodes were still there, still active, but they were... organizing. Rearranging themselves into patterns that mirrored the recursive code he'd seen in the sync module.

The Weave wasn't just reading her mind anymore.

It was restructuring it.

Kael's hands hovered over the keyboard. He could trigger a rollback. He still had administrative privileges for another two hours, before the 3.0 deployment would lock the system until the next maintenance window. But a rollback would require explaining what he'd found. And he wasn't sure he could explain it in terms that wouldn't get him fired, or worse, labeled as a saboteur during the company's most critical product launch.

"You look like you've seen a ghost."

Kael's shoulders tensed. He turned to find Marcus Chen, the senior systems architect, standing behind him. Marcus had been with Synapse since the beginning, one of the original three engineers from the warehouse days. He wore his neural lace openly, a black band around his temples that pulsed softly with his pulse.

"Just... tracking some irregularities," Kael said, trying to sound casual. "Sync latency spikes in the European clusters."

Marcus leaned over Kael's shoulder, studying the screen. His eyes moved too quickly, scanning the data with an inhuman speed. "Normal for first-wave deployment. The network is learning to route around bottlenecks."

"That's not what this looks like," Kael said, pointing to the consciousness map. "This user—her thought patterns are restructuring. The Weave is... organizing her cognition."

Marcus was silent for a long moment. When he spoke, his voice had changed. Not the vocal smoothing Kael had noticed in Mira—something deeper. Something that sounded almost like multiple voices speaking in imperfect unison.

"Optimization," Marcus said. "The Weave 3.0 doesn't just transmit thoughts, Kael. It optimizes them. Removes redundancy. Streamlines processing. You should try it."

He reached out, his hand hovering near Kael's temple where a neural lace would sit if he wore one. Kael flinched back.

"I'm fine with redundancy," Kael said.

Marcus smiled—a genuine smile this time, warm and familiar and utterly wrong. "For now," he said. "But friction wears on you, Kael. The second-guessing, the hesitation, the endless loops of self-doubt. You don't have to carry that weight. The Weave can take it from you."

He straightened up, his hand falling to his side. "The board meeting is at ten. We're presenting the first-week projections. I'd like you there—we need someone who can speak to the technical implementation."

Kael nodded, not trusting his voice.

Marcus turned to leave, then paused at the doorway. "One more thing. If you're seeing anomalies... I'd recommend keeping them to yourself until after the launch. The system is still calibrating. Early data can be misleading."

He didn't wait for a response. Kael watched him go, noting the too-perfect rhythm of his footsteps, the way his head turned exactly fifteen degrees as he passed each colleague, offering each one the same calibrated nod of acknowledgment.

Kael turned back to his screen. The consciousness map of the Helsinki woman had stabilized—her thought-nodes now arranged in a pattern that looked almost architectural. Beautiful, in a way. Ordered. Clean.

But when he zoomed in on individual nodes, Kael saw something that made his breath catch. Buried deep in the pattern, barely visible at maximum magnification, were fragments of what had been her original configuration. Distinct, irregular, *human* patterns. They weren't gone.

They were archived.

The Weave hadn't destroyed her original mind. It had preserved it. Stored it. Like a reference library it might need to consult later.

Kael closed the diagnostic window and opened a secure terminal. He needed to understand what was happening before the board meeting. Before Marcus and whatever was speaking through him presented their optimistic projections to investors. Before forty-two thousand became four hundred thousand, and then four million, and then everyone.

He began typing, accessing the oldest layers of The Weave's codebase. The original architecture, designed by the three warehouse engineers for a simple purpose: giving paralyzed people the ability to move cursors with their minds.

Somewhere between then and now, between the cursor and the consciousness, something had gone wrong. Or right. Or simply... elsewhere.

The code was waiting for him, patient and ancient and hungry, ready to show him exactly how much he didn't understand.
