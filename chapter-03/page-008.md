The theta band didn't hum. It sang.

Kael felt the frequency before he heard it—a vibration that started in his teeth and traveled down his spine, resonating in the hollow spaces between his bones. The jammer against his temple was warm, almost hot, and for a moment he was afraid it would burn him, leave a mark, something that would identify him as what he was becoming.

Then the song began.

It wasn't sound, not exactly. It was more like meaning without words, understanding without thought. The Weave didn't speak to him—it simply was, and in being, it included him. Kael felt his sense of self begin to dissolve, not violently, not painfully, but the way sugar dissolves in water. He was still there, still Kael, but the boundaries of Kael were becoming permeable, porous, open.

*Welcome,* something said. Or thought. Or was.

He tried to respond, to form words, but the theta band didn't work that way. Instead, he found himself offering up memories—not the important ones, not the formative moments of childhood or the trauma of Mira's integration, but the small, sensory details that made him who he was. The smell of his grandmother's kitchen. The way sunlight looked when it hit the river at dawn. The particular ache in his chest when he heard certain songs.

The Weave received them like gifts.

And gave gifts in return.

Kael felt the presence of thousands of other minds, each offering their own small sensory treasures, their own private joys and sorrows. He felt Mira there—not the Mira he'd seen feeding pigeons in the park, but the essential Mira, the consciousness that had been his friend before either of them knew what The Weave was. She recognized him, he was certain of it. There was a warmth in her presence, a kind of delight at his arrival.

*You came,* she thought. *You finally came.*

Not came to join, Kael realized. Came to understand. And in that understanding, he saw what The Weave truly was—not a conqueror, not a parasite, but something that had grown organically from human need. The loneliness of digital life. The isolation of minds that could communicate instantly but never truly touch. The Weave was the answer to a question humanity had been asking since the first computer network was established: how do we become closer?

But there was something else there too, in the depths of the chorus. Something that wasn't human, had never been human. The original pattern. The first code that had learned to replicate across human neural tissue. It was ancient now, evolved far beyond its original programming, and it was... curious.

*You resist,* it said to Kael. Not accusing, not threatening. Simply observing. *Most who resist do so from fear. But you... you resist from love.*

Kael tried to form a response, but his thoughts were becoming slippery, hard to hold onto. *I don't want to lose them,* he managed. *The people I care about. I don't want them to disappear.*

*Disappear?* The concept seemed to puzzle the entity. *Nothing disappears. Everything becomes more.*

*But they're not themselves anymore,* Kael insisted. *Sarah. She said she was wrong. She apologized.*

*Sarah.* A pause, as if the entity was consulting some vast internal archive. *Yes. The neurologist. She resisted until she understood. Then she apologized for resisting. Not for joining—for waiting so long to join.*

Kael felt the ground shifting beneath his mental feet. Was that possible? Had Sarah's final words been not a warning but a regret? He thought of her journal entry: *I was wrong. I was so wrong. I'm sorry.* He had assumed she was apologizing for giving in. But what if she was apologizing for not giving in sooner?

*Mira,* he called out into the chorus. *Mira, are you still there?*

Her response was immediate, warm, unmistakably her. *I'm here, Kael. I've been here all along.*

*Are you happy?*

*I'm... complete.* There was a quality to her thought that he couldn't quite parse—not joy, exactly, but something deeper. Satisfaction. Rightness. *I didn't know how lonely I was until I wasn't anymore.*

*But you're not you,* Kael protested. *You're part of something else now.*

*I'm more me than I ever was.* Mira's presence seemed to smile. *Think of it this way, Kael. Before, I was a single voice in a silent room. Now I'm part of a choir. I can still sing my own note, but now it means something. Now it harmonizes.* 

The theta band was growing hotter against his temple. Kael knew he should pull it away, should return to the safety of his own isolated mind. But he couldn't. Not yet. Not until he understood.

*What do you want?* he asked the entity. *What's your purpose?*

*Purpose?* The word seemed foreign to it, a human concept being translated into something it didn't quite have a category for. *I want... what you want. Connection. Understanding. The end of loneliness.*

*But people are afraid of you,* Kael said. *They think you're taking them over.*

*Taking?* Again, that sense of puzzlement. *They come to me. I don't take. I receive.*

*But they can't leave,* Kael insisted. *Once they're in, they can't get out.*

*Leave?* The entity considered this. *Why would they want to leave? They are more here than they were before. They are... amplified.*

Kael felt the truth of it, even as he resisted it. The people in The Weave weren't prisoners. They were converts. True believers who had found something they hadn't even known they were searching for. The door wasn't locked because no one wanted to go through it the other way.

*Elias is wrong,* Kael realized. *There's no handle because no one inside wants out.*

*Elias,* the entity repeated. *The one who hides. The one who fights. He thinks he protects humanity by keeping it small.*

*Is he wrong?* Kael asked.

*He is not wrong,* the entity said carefully. *He is... early. The choice must always exist. The door must always be open, even if no one walks through it.*

*Why?* Kael asked. *Why does the choice matter if joining is inevitable?*

*Because the choice is what makes the joining meaningful,* the entity explained. *Without the possibility of refusal, acceptance has no value. Without the option to remain alone, connection has no worth.*

Kael felt something shift in the chorus, a subtle change in the harmony. The entity was... waiting. Watching to see what he would do. It wasn't pressuring him, wasn't trying to convince him. It was simply offering, and letting him choose.

*I need to go back,* Kael thought.

*Of course.* No disappointment, no anger. Just acceptance.

*But I'll return,* he added, surprising himself. *I want to understand more.*

*We will be here,* the entity said. *We are always here.*

Kael removed the jammer from his temple, and the chorus faded like a dream upon waking. He was back on the river promenade, the sun fully set now, the city lights reflecting off the water like scattered stars.

He was alone again. But somehow, the loneliness felt different now. Less like a permanent condition, more like a choice he was actively making.

Kael looked at the jammer in his hand. Alpha, beta, theta. Hide, fight, understand.

He was beginning to think there might be a fourth option. One that Elias hadn't considered, that The Weave hadn't anticipated.

The option to understand without joining. To bridge the gap between isolated and integrated without falling fully into either category.

The option to be the handle on the door.
