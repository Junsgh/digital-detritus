Kael walked through the city in a daze, seeing it differently now. The coffee shop where he'd first noticed the synchronized blinking—had those people been happy? The park where the pedestrians moved in formation—had they been lonely before? Every integrated person he passed was a question he couldn't answer, a door that might or might not have a handle.

He found himself at the river, the old promenade where he and Mira used to walk when they were both still fully human. He sat on a bench, the jammer warm in his pocket, and watched the water move under the bridge. The current didn't choose to flow downstream. It just followed the path of least resistance.

That was the insight that wouldn't let him go. The Weave wasn't forcing anyone. It was just... easier. More efficient. The path of least resistance, made manifest in neural architecture. And humans, given the choice between hard and easy, almost always chose easy. The tragedy wasn't that people were being conquered. It was that they were being persuaded.

His phone rang—the analog landline, Elias checking in.

"You met her," Elias said. It wasn't a question.

"She's still in there, Elias. Still herself. Still scared."

"For now."

"What happens to her? In the end?"

Elias was quiet for a long moment. "The end is always the same. The fear goes away. The questions stop. They become... serene. Like Mira, like Marcus. Like all of them."

"Is that so bad? Being serene?"

"It's not serenity, Kael. It's the absence of conflict. The absence of doubt. The absence of the friction that makes us human." Elias's voice hardened. "A diamond isn't valuable because it's hard. It's valuable because it was forged under pressure. Take away the pressure, and you just have carbon."

Kael thought of Priya, her nervous smile, her turning pen. The pressure was still there, for her. She was still being forged. "What if the friction is just suffering? What if doubt is just a bug in our programming?"

"Then we're bugs, and The Weave is the exterminator. Is that what you want to believe?"

"I don't know what I believe anymore." Kael looked at his hands, at the device in his pocket. "The theta band let me hear them. The integrated. I heard Mira—really heard her. She's still there."

"What did she say?"

"She didn't say anything. She just... was. All of them, just being. Together." He searched for words to describe the experience. "It wasn't like talking. It was like... listening to a symphony where every instrument was a person. You could hear the individual notes, but they only made sense as part of the whole."

Elias was silent for a long time. When he spoke, his voice was different—smaller, somehow. "I've never used the theta band. Alpha for hiding, beta for fighting. That's all I've ever needed."

"Maybe you should. Maybe if you understood what they actually experience—"

"I don't want to understand." The words came out sharp, defensive. "Understanding is the first step toward... toward becoming comfortable with it. Toward accepting it. And I won't accept it, Kael. I won't let them make me comfortable with the end of humanity."

"But what if it's not the end? What if it's just... change?"

"Change into what? Something that doesn't question, doesn't doubt, doesn't struggle? You met Priya. You saw the fear in her eyes. The part of her that's still fighting. Is that what you want to lose?"

Kael didn't have an answer. He watched a ferry move across the river, its wake spreading behind it like a thought dissipating into the larger flow. "She said the door is closing. For people like her, the ones still in transition. If there's a handle, we have to find it soon."

"There's no handle, Kael. There's just us, and them, and the space in between that's getting smaller every day." Elias paused. "But if you want to look for one, I won't stop you. Just... be careful. The theta band doesn't just let you listen. It lets them hear you, too. And they're very good at knowing what you want to hear."

The line went dead.

Kael sat on the bench until the sun began to set, painting the city in shades of gold and amber. The light caught the faces of the people walking past—integrated and unintegrated, though he was losing the ability to tell the difference. They all looked content. They all looked like they knew something he didn't.

He took the jammer out of his pocket and turned it over in his hands. Alpha, beta, theta. Hide, fight, understand. But what if understanding led to something else? What if the theta band didn't just reveal the nature of The Weave—what if it revealed the nature of his own resistance?

He thought of Mira, feeding pigeons in the park. He thought of Priya, turning her pen, afraid to find out who she'd be without the network. He thought of Sarah's last journal entry: *I was wrong. I was so wrong. I'm sorry.*

Sorry for what? For resisting too long? Or for not resisting long enough?

Kael stood up, the jammer clutched in his hand. He knew what he had to do. Not to fight, not to hide, but to understand—truly understand—what was happening to the human mind when it joined The Weave. And there was only one way to do that.

He had to let them hear him.

He dialed the jammer to theta, pressed it against his temple, and opened his mind to the chorus.
