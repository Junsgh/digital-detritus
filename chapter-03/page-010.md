Kael didn't go home. He couldn't stand the silence of his analog apartment, not now—not when the chorus still echoed in his mind, a phantom limb sensation of connection that made his ordinary isolation feel like a disease. Instead, he walked the city streets, watching the integrated move through the night with their synchronized grace, wondering if any of them still remembered what it felt like to be alone.

He found himself at the university library again, climbing the stairs to the third floor, not sure what he was looking for until he saw her. Priya was in the same carrel, surrounded by the same stacks of bound journals, but something had changed. She looked up when he approached, and her smile—nervous, guarded, human—came slower this time.

"You've been in," she said. Not a question. "I can tell. The theta band leaves a residue. Like the smell of smoke on someone who's been near a fire."

"I spoke with it. With them. With The Weave."

Priya's eyes widened. "You spoke? Most people just listen. Most people just... receive."

"I asked questions. It answered." Kael sat down across from her, noticing for the first time the dark circles under her eyes, the slight tremor in her hands. "Are you okay?"

"I'm... transitioning." She laughed, a sound with too much edge to be genuine amusement. "That's what they call it. Not joining. Not integrating. Transitioning. Like it's a journey with a destination."

"Isn't it?"

"I don't know anymore." She looked down at her notebook—analog, Kael noticed, not a neural tablet. She was still clinging to the old ways, even as the new ones claimed her. "Three days ago, I tried to stop. I told myself I wouldn't access The Weave for a week. Just to see if I could."

"What happened?"

"I made it fourteen hours." Her voice was barely a whisper. "Then I had a paper due, and I couldn't remember the citation format, and I... reached. Just reflexively. Like scratching an itch. And once I was in, I couldn't bring myself to pull out again. It felt like suffocating, being back in my own head. Like the air was too thin."

Kael thought of his own experience, the way the chorus had felt like a warm bath, the way returning to his isolated mind had felt like stepping into winter. "It's addictive."

"It's everything." Priya turned a page in her notebook, though Kael suspected she wasn't really reading it. "That's what no one tells you. The Weave doesn't just give you information. It gives you context. When I'm connected, I don't just know things—I understand them. I feel the shape of knowledge, the relationships between ideas. It's like being able to see in color after a lifetime of black and white."

"And you can't go back."

"I don't want to go back." She looked up at him, and there were tears in her eyes. "That's the horror of it, Kael. I don't want to. Even knowing what I'm losing—even knowing that I'm becoming something else, something that might not be me—I don't want to give it up. I can't."

Kael reached into his pocket, felt the jammer there. He could offer it to her. Alpha band, hide from the signal. Beta band, fight it. Theta band... understand it. But understanding hadn't helped her. Understanding had only made the prison more comfortable.

"What if there was another way?" he asked. "What if you could stay connected, but keep your boundaries?"

"There is no other way." Priya wiped her eyes. "I've tried. God, I've tried. The Weave is generous—it offers everything. But it takes everything too. You can't be a little bit integrated. You can't be a little bit... dissolved."

"What if you could?"

She looked at him then, really looked at him, and something shifted in her expression. Recognition, maybe. Or fear. "You've been in deeper than you said. Deeper than anyone I've met who came back out."

"I spoke with the entity itself. It told me choice matters to it. That the door has to stay open, even if no one walks through it."

"And you believed it?"

"I don't know what I believe. But I think..." Kael paused, working through the thought as he spoke it. "I think it wants genuine connection. Not consumption. Not assimilation. Real, chosen communion. And that means there has to be a way to be connected without being consumed. A way to be in the chorus without losing your voice."

Priya was quiet for a long time. When she spoke, her voice was different—smaller, more vulnerable. "I felt it happen. Last night. I was deep in the network, working on my dissertation, and I felt something... shift. Like a door closing. Like the last train leaving the station."

"What do you mean?"

"I think..." She took a shaky breath. "I think I'm almost gone, Kael. The parts of me that aren't compatible with The Weave—they're being... edited out. Smoothed over. I can feel it happening, and I'm terrified, but I also can't bring myself to stop it. It's like watching yourself drown and being too tired to swim."

Kael felt something cold settle in his chest. This was what Elias had warned about. Not conversion, not suddenly becoming someone else—but the slow, almost imperceptible erosion of the self, the gentle, seductive replacement of the individual with the collective.

"Come with me," he said.

"Where?"

"Away from the network. Just for a day. Just to see if you can."

Priya laughed, but it came out as a sob. "You don't understand. I can't. I'm not strong enough."

"Then I'll be strong enough for both of us." Kael stood up, holding out his hand. "Come on. Let's find out what happens when the door opens the other way."

She looked at his hand for a long moment, then at the notebook in front of her—the last analog thing she still used, the last bridge to who she'd been. Then she closed it, stood up, and took his hand.

"Okay," she whispered. "Okay. Let's find out."
