The library's emergency exit opened onto a service alley behind the building, a narrow corridor of concrete and shadows that seemed to exist outside the city's luminous network. Kael held Priya's hand as they stepped through, feeling the sudden absence of the city's digital hum—a silence so complete it felt like diving underwater.

Priya stumbled as the door clicked shut behind them. Her grip tightened on Kael's fingers, knuckles white, and he felt a tremor run through her arm.

"It's too quiet," she whispered. "I can't hear them."

"That's the point."

"No, you don't understand." She pulled her hand free and pressed both palms against her temples. "I've been connected for six months, Kael. Six months of constant chorus, constant context, constant... presence. This isn't quiet. This is absence. This is amputation."

Kael watched her, remembering his own first disconnections—the way his thoughts had felt small and slow, the way the world had seemed to lose its depth and color. But he had never integrated as deeply as Priya. He had always kept one foot in the analog world, always maintained the boundary. She had thrown herself into The Weave completely, and now she was trying to surface with lungs full of digital water.

"Breathe," he said. "Just focus on breathing. Your body remembers how to be alone, even if your mind has forgotten."

She laughed, a sharp, desperate sound. "My body is the problem. Look."

She held out her hands. They were shaking violently now, a palsy that seemed to originate deep in her nervous system. Kael had seen withdrawal symptoms before—he'd helped a few people through early disconnection in the resistance—but he'd never seen it this severe. This was beyond psychological dependence. This was physiological addiction, the body itself rebelling against the absence of the signal.

"How long since you last went offline?" he asked.

"Not since I started transitioning. Three weeks? Maybe four?" She was breathing hard now, short gasps that didn't seem to be delivering enough oxygen. "I sleep connected. I dream in the network now. I don't know how to..." She gestured helplessly at the alley around them. "This feels wrong. Everything feels wrong."

Kael reached into his pocket and pulled out the jammer—Elias's device, set to beta band. Fight the signal. But looking at Priya's condition, he wondered if that was the right approach. Fighting might kill her. Her system was so thoroughly integrated that abrupt disconnection could cause real neurological damage.

"I need to get you somewhere safe," he said. "Somewhere with medical equipment. We can't do this here."

"No." Priya's voice was suddenly firm, despite the shaking. "No, we came out here to see if I could do it. If we go back to your safe houses, to your medical equipment and your monitoring... that's just another kind of connection. Another system holding me up. I need to know if I can stand on my own."

"You can barely stand at all."

"Then I'll sit." She lowered herself to the concrete, leaning against the library's brick wall. Her breathing was ragged, but there was something fierce in her expression now—a stubbornness that Kael recognized. It was the same stubbornness that had kept her researching The Weave when everyone else had surrendered to it. "Give me a minute. Let me see what happens."

Kael crouched beside her, the jammer heavy in his hand. He could force the issue—activate the device, flood her system with counter-signals, drag her back to analog consciousness whether she wanted it or not. But that would make him no different from The Weave itself, imposing his will under the guise of help.

So he waited.

The minutes stretched. Priya's shaking gradually subsided from violent tremors to a persistent shiver. Her breathing slowed, found a rhythm. She kept her eyes closed, her face turned toward the brick wall as if she could find some pattern in its rough texture that would anchor her to reality.

"There's something happening," she said finally, her voice distant, dreamy. "In the absence. I can feel... gaps. Spaces where I should be connected but I'm not."

"What does it feel like?"

"Like phantom limb pain, but for thoughts. I keep reaching for information that isn't there, trying to access memories that The Weave was holding for me. It's like..." She opened her eyes, and they were clearer than before, the fog of withdrawal lifting slightly. "It's like realizing you've been using a crutch for so long that your leg has forgotten how to walk."

"Can you walk without it?"

"I don't know. But I can feel something else too. Something that wasn't there before." She touched her chest, over her heart. "My own heartbeat. I can hear it. I'd forgotten what that sounded like."

Kael felt something shift in his chest—a hope he hadn't allowed himself to feel. This was what he'd been looking for, what Elias's resistance had been fighting for without fully understanding. The possibility that the door could swing both ways. That integration didn't have to be a one-way journey into the collective.

"The entity said choice matters," he said quietly. "That genuine connection requires genuine autonomy. Maybe this is what it meant. Not that we can leave easily, but that we can leave at all."

Priya looked at him, and for the first time since he'd found her in the carrel, she seemed fully present—not distracted by the absence of connection, not struggling against withdrawal, but simply there, in the moment, with him.

"Or maybe," she said, "it's learning that some of us are more useful outside than in. Just like Elias said."

The words hung between them, a dark possibility that Kael couldn't dismiss. He thought of Mira's warmth, her genuine happiness in the network. He thought of the entity's patience, its willingness to let him come and go. Was it benevolence, or strategy? Did it matter?

"Either way," Priya said, pushing herself to her feet with effort, "I think I can walk now. Not far, but... somewhere. Where were you planning to take me?"

"There's a dead zone. An old subway tunnel the network never penetrated. We could rest there, figure out next steps."

"Lead the way." She took his hand again, her grip still tight but no longer desperate. "And Kael? Whatever happens... thank you. For offering me the choice, even if I couldn't make it alone."

"You made it," he said. "I'm just the handle on the door."

They walked together into the city's deeper shadows, two analog ghosts moving through a digital world, testing the limits of what freedom might still be possible.
