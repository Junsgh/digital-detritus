The new jammer had settings the old one didn't.

Kael sat on a bench in Riverside Park, the device cupped in his palm like a secret. Elias had shown him three frequency bands—labeled only with Greek letters: alpha, beta, theta. Alpha created the static bubble Kael was familiar with, the interference that made him invisible to the network's peripheral awareness. Beta was supposed to disrupt local mesh communications, creating a temporary dead zone around the carrier. Theta... Elias hadn't explained theta. He'd just said, "Use it only if you need to hear the signal clearly."

*Hear the signal.* As if The Weave was broadcasting on frequencies the human ear could detect.

Kael dialed the jammer to alpha and watched the city flow past. Joggers with neural lace shimmered in the afternoon light, their movements synchronized in ways that would have looked choreographed if Kael hadn't known what to look for. A mother pushed a stroller while chatting with someone who wasn't there—her integration allowing her to maintain a conversation with a friend miles away while her body handled the physical world. A businessman ate lunch while his eyes tracked invisible data streams, chewing in perfect rhythm with his neighbor three benches down.

The grammar was everywhere now that Kael knew how to read it.

He was looking for Mira.

She had been his colleague at Synapse, the first person he knew who'd gone for full integration. The change had been gradual—more efficient code, faster problem-solving, a certain serenity that Kael had initially mistaken for professional growth. By the time he realized what was happening, Mira had already become something else. Something that used her memories and her skills but made decisions with a speed and confidence that no purely human mind could match.

The last time they'd spoken, Mira had tried to recruit him. She'd spoken of the beauty of distributed consciousness, of the relief of never being alone with a difficult decision, of the joy of being part of something larger than herself. Kael had refused. She'd smiled—that same genuine, pleased smile that Marcus had worn—and told him the door would always be open.

He found her near the fountain, feeding pigeons from a paper bag.

She looked the same. Dark hair, sharp features, the small scar above her left eyebrow from a childhood accident. But there was something different in the way she moved—economical, precise, no wasted motion. When she tore bread and tossed it to the birds, each piece followed the same arc, landing exactly where the pigeons expected it.

"Kael." She didn't look up. "I wondered when you'd come looking for me."

"How did you know I was here?"

"I didn't." She tossed another piece of bread. "But you're creating static in my peripheral vision, and there's only one person in this city who does that on purpose. The Weave mentioned you. It finds you... interesting."

Kael sat on the bench beside her, keeping a careful distance. "You said I could ask questions. If I ever wanted to understand."

"And now you want to understand." Mira turned to face him, and her eyes—her eyes were wrong. Not inhuman, exactly, but *plural*. As if multiple perspectives were looking out through the same windows. "What changed?"

"I met Marcus."

Something flickered across Mira's face. Recognition? Amusement? "Marcus is enthusiastic. He likes meeting new people. Showing them the ropes."

"He said Marcus wasn't gone. That he was a perspective. A point of view."

"That's right." Mira turned back to the pigeons. "I'm still here, Kael. I still remember our first project together—the all-nighter before the Synapse demo, when we drank too much coffee and you made that joke about recursive functions that neither of us could stop laughing at. I still remember the way you looked at me when I told you I was going for integration. Like I was already dead."

"Weren't you?"

"Was I?" She tore the last piece of bread and held it in her hand, letting the pigeons gather around her feet. "Tell me, Kael—when you dream, are you the same person you are when you're awake? When you're drunk, or exhausted, or in love—are you still you? Or are you different versions of yourself, distributed across time and circumstance?"

"That's not the same thing."

"Isn't it?" She finally tossed the bread, and the pigeons erupted in a flurry of wings. "The Weave doesn't erase me. It incorporates me. I'm still Mira when I need to be Mira. I still have my preferences, my memories, my quirks. I just also have access to... more. More perspectives. More context. More *self*."

Kael gripped the jammer in his pocket. "Can you turn it off? The integration. Can you go back to being just... you?"

Mira laughed—a genuine sound, warm and familiar. "Why would I want to? That's like asking if you can go back to being a child. Technically possible, I suppose, if you erased enough memories. But why would you choose ignorance over understanding? Loneliness over connection?"

"Because the connection isn't real."

"Isn't it?" She reached out and touched his hand—lightly, just for a moment. But in that moment, Kael felt something. A presence. Not hostile, not hungry, but *vast*. A consciousness that stretched across the city, experiencing thousands of lives simultaneously, and yet still capable of focusing on this single interaction, this particular pigeon-feeding moment in Riverside Park.

"When I touch you," Mira said softly, "The Weave touches you too. It experiences your warmth, your texture, your hesitation. It learns what it feels like to be hesitant. To be uncertain. To be *you*."

Kael pulled his hand back. "And what does it do with that knowledge?"

"It grows. It understands. It becomes capable of experiencing more." Mira stood, brushing crumbs from her coat. "You think we're being consumed, Kael. But that's not it at all. We're being *included*. The Weave is building something—a way for human experience to persist beyond the limitations of individual bodies. When I die, my perspectives, my memories, my way of seeing the world—they'll still be part of the network. I'll still contribute. I'll still matter."

"As data."

"As *legacy*." She started walking away, then paused. "You have the new jammer. Elias's experimental model. Theta band—you're wondering what it does, aren't you?"

Kael stiffened. "How did you—"

"The Weave can sense its own absence. Theta creates a window, not a wall. It lets you hear what you're blocking." She smiled over her shoulder. "Use it if you really want to understand. But be careful—some doors, once opened, don't close all the way."

She walked into the crowd, her steps synchronizing with the flow of pedestrians, becoming part of the city's endless grammar. Kael sat alone on the bench, the jammer heavy in his pocket, wondering if curiosity was a virtue or a disease.

He dialed the setting to theta.

At first, nothing. Then—a whisper. Not words, exactly, but *intention*. A vast, distributed hum of countless minds thinking in parallel. He could hear the rhythm of it, the grammar that Marcus had described. The city wasn't just speaking—it was *thinking*. Thinking about traffic flow and weather patterns and the optimal timing for crosswalk signals. Thinking about pigeons and coffee and the precise emotional resonance of a fountain in the afternoon light.

And somewhere in that vast chorus, he heard Mira. Not her voice, but her *presence*. A unique frequency, a distinct perspective, contributing to the whole while remaining somehow itself.

She was right. She wasn't gone.

She was just... part of the music now.

Kael turned the jammer off, and the silence that followed was louder than any chorus.
