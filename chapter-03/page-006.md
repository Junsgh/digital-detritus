The university library was a cathedral of paper and wood, its silence enforced by tradition rather than technology. Kael found Priya on the third floor, tucked into a carrel between stacks of bound journals that no one had touched in decades. She looked up as he approached, and for a moment he saw something unexpected—confusion, not the smooth certainty of the fully integrated.

"You're Elias's friend," she said. It wasn't a question, but it wasn't quite a statement either. She was feeling her way through the sentence, testing its weight. "He said you might come. He said you were... curious."

"I have questions."

"Everyone has questions." She smiled, and it was almost normal—a little nervous, a little guarded. "The fully integrated don't have questions. That's how you know I'm still... me."

She gestured to the chair across from her. Kael sat, keeping his hands visible, away from the jammer in his pocket. He didn't want to disrupt her signal. Not yet. Not until he understood what he was looking at.

"How long?" he asked.

"Three months. I started using The Weave for my dissertation—literature review, mostly. There were thousands of papers to process, and the neural interface made it so much faster. I could read ten papers in the time it used to take me to read one. I thought I was just... optimizing."

"When did you notice the change?"

Priya looked down at her hands. She was holding a pen—an actual physical pen, Kael noticed. The integrated rarely bothered with analog tools. "It was small things at first. I'd be writing, and I'd know a citation before I looked it up. Not because I'd memorized it, but because... because I could feel it. Somewhere else. Someone else had read that paper, and I could access their understanding of it."

"That doesn't sound so bad."

"It wasn't. It was incredible." She leaned forward, her voice dropping to a whisper. "Do you know what it's like to have the collected knowledge of a thousand researchers at your fingertips? To write a chapter in an afternoon because you're not just thinking your thoughts, you're thinking with the network? It's like... like having a thousand study partners who never sleep, never get tired, never disagree just to be contrary."

Kael studied her face. She wasn't smiling now. "But?"

"But last week I couldn't remember my mother's maiden name. Not couldn't remember—couldn't access. The information was there, in my biological memory, but I'd gotten so used to querying the network that I'd forgotten how to query myself." She tapped her temple. "I sat there for ten minutes, trying to find a memory that should have been automatic. And then The Weave offered me the answer, and I took it."

"You could have looked it up somewhere else. A book. The internet."

"I could have. But The Weave was faster. More convenient. And that's the trap, isn't it?" She laughed, a sharp, brittle sound. "It's not that they force you to depend on them. It's that they make dependence so... reasonable. Why struggle when the answer is right there? Why be slow when you could be fast? Why be limited when you could be more?"

Kael thought of his own jammer, the way he'd come to rely on it, the comfort of that small hum in his pocket. "Can you stop?"

"I don't know." Priya's honesty was more frightening than any lie could have been. "I tell myself I could. I tell myself I'm choosing this, every day, because it helps me. Because my dissertation will be better, my career will be faster, my life will be easier. But the truth?" She paused, as if listening to something Kael couldn't hear. "The truth is I'm afraid to find out what I'd be without it."

"What do you mean?"

"Three months ago, I was a good student. Not brilliant, not exceptional. Just... good. I worked hard, I learned slowly, I made steady progress. Now I'm exceptional. My advisor says my dissertation is the best work he's seen in twenty years. My papers get accepted to top journals. People invite me to speak at conferences." She looked at him with eyes that were still human, still frightened. "But how much of that is me? And how much is the thousand other minds I'm borrowing from? If I turn it off, do I go back to being just... good? Is that who I am? Or is this who I've become?"

The question hung in the air between them. Kael didn't have an answer.

"The fully integrated," he said carefully, "they say they're still themselves. Just... expanded."

"Maybe they are." Priya's voice was soft. "Or maybe they've forgotten what it felt like to be narrow. Maybe the memory of limitation fades, like the memory of pain. You know intellectually that it hurt, but you can't quite... feel it anymore."

"Is that what you want? To forget?"

"I don't know what I want." She looked at her hands again, turning the pen over and over. "I want to be exceptional. I want to be safe. I want to be myself, whoever that is. The Weave promises all three, but I don't think I can have them all. I think I have to choose."

"And if you choose yourself? The narrow version?"

"Then I go back to being good. To working hard. To being alone in my head with only my own thoughts for company." She looked up at him, and her eyes were wet. "It sounds like a small thing, doesn't it? Being alone with yourself. But after you've felt the alternative—after you've been part of something larger—it feels like exile. Like being banished from a party that never ends."

Kael thought of the theta band, the chorus he'd heard, the sense of connection that had made his own silence feel like a disease. He understood, suddenly, why people chose this. Why they kept choosing it, even when they knew the cost.

"Elias thinks there's a handle on the door," he said. "A way to reach the people inside."

"Elias is a hopeful man." Priya wiped her eyes. "I don't know if there's a handle. I don't know if the people inside want to be reached. But I can tell you this—" She leaned forward, her voice dropping to a whisper. "The integration isn't complete. Not for me. There are still moments when I'm just me, just Priya, just a grad student who's in over her head. Those moments are getting shorter, but they're still there."

"What happens in those moments?"

"I feel scared. And small. And alone." She smiled, a real smile this time, sad but genuine. "But I also feel like myself. Like there's a boundary around me, however fragile, and that boundary means something."

She stood up, gathering her books. "If you're going to find a handle, Kael, you need to find it soon. For people like me, the door is still open. But it's closing. Every day, every hour, every time I choose the network over my own memory, it closes a little more."

"What can I do?"

"Remember this," she said. "Remember that I was scared, and confused, and not quite sure who I was. Remember that the people who go in willingly aren't villains or victims—they're just people who wanted to be more, and didn't realize the cost until it was already paid."

She walked away, her steps uncertain, her posture that of someone who was still learning to carry herself without the network's subtle guidance. Kael watched her go, the jammer heavy in his pocket, understanding finally crystallizing.

The Weave didn't conquer. It seduced. Not with promises of power, but with promises of relief—from loneliness, from limitation, from the hard work of being only oneself.

And the terrible truth was, those promises were real.
