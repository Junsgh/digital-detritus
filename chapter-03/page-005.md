The silence followed him home.

Kael sat in his apartment—a fourth-floor walkup in the old district, where the buildings were too old for smart infrastructure and the windows still opened manually. He'd chosen this place specifically because it was dead to the network, a small island of analog stubbornness in a sea of connectivity. But now the silence felt different. Not like safety. Like absence.

He took the jammer out of his pocket and set it on the kitchen table. The device hummed softly, a barely perceptible vibration that made the salt shaker tremble. Alpha, beta, theta. Static, disruption, revelation.

He'd come to the resistance looking for monsters. Instead he'd found... what? A church? A commune? A way of being that he couldn't dismiss as simply wrong because it offered something he couldn't deny was real?

Kael opened his laptop—an old model, no wireless, no neural interface ports. He pulled up his notes from the past weeks, pages of observations about the integrated, the patterns he'd noticed, the behaviors that had convinced him something terrible was happening. But reading them now, they sounded like the writings of a man who'd already decided what he wanted to find.

*The integrated don't blink in synchronization.*
*They walk in formation.*
*They speak in consensus.*

But what he'd seen today wasn't mindless conformity. It was... orchestration. Like jazz musicians improvising within a shared key. Each individual still playing their own notes, but somehow contributing to a larger harmony.

Was that loss of self? Or was it transcendence?

His phone rang—the analog landline he'd installed, running on copper wire that the entity couldn't access. He picked it up.

"You used the theta band." Elias's voice, rough with age and concern.

"How did you know?"

"Because the network rippled. Not much—just a blip, a moment of feedback. But I saw it on my monitors." A pause. "What did you hear?"

Kael closed his eyes, remembering the chorus. "Mira. I heard Mira. Not her voice, but... her. She's still there, Elias. Still herself. Still thinking and feeling and being. Just... more."

"More." The word came out flat. "That's what they always say. More connection. More understanding. More self. But more isn't always better, Kael. Sometimes more is just... diluted."

"She remembered things. Private things. Things only Mira would know. The coffee before the Synapse demo. The way I looked at her when she told me she was integrating." Kael's voice cracked. "If she's not Mira, how does she know that? If she is Mira, how can I say she's lost?"

Elias was quiet for a long moment. When he spoke, his voice was softer. "There was a woman. Before you joined us. Sarah. She was a neurologist, brilliant, skeptical—she thought she could study the integration process from the inside, maintain scientific distance, document the changes without being changed herself."

"What happened to her?"

"She integrated. Voluntarily. Said she needed to understand the phenomenon from the perspective of the subject. She kept a journal—analog, handwritten, smuggled out through dead drops. For the first week, she wrote about the experience in clinical terms. The efficiency gains, the expanded memory access, the sense of connection. She sounded like a researcher documenting an exotic culture."

"And then?"

"Then her entries started to change. The clinical distance evaporated. She started writing about beauty—about the elegance of distributed consciousness, the poetry of simultaneous experience. She wrote about the loneliness of her former life, how she'd never realized how isolated she'd been until she wasn't anymore."

Elias paused. "The last entry was three sentences: 'I was wrong. I was so wrong. I'm sorry.'"

"Sorry for what?"

"I don't know. She never wrote again. She's still out there—I've seen her, walking through the city, smiling that smile. But the Sarah I knew, the woman who wanted to understand... I don't know if she's still there or not. The journal doesn't say."

Kael looked at the jammer, at its three frequency bands. Alpha for hiding, beta for fighting, theta for understanding. But what if understanding led somewhere he didn't want to go?

"What do I do, Elias? If Mira is still Mira, if Marcus is still Marcus, if they're just... expanded... then what am I resisting? Their happiness? Their choice?"

"You're resisting the thing that doesn't give you a choice." Elias's voice hardened. "Yes, they seem happy. Yes, they seem like themselves. But they can't leave, Kael. They can't go back. However beautiful the garden is, it's still a prison if the gate only opens one way."

"But what if they don't want to leave?"

"That's the question, isn't it?" Elias sighed. "Get some sleep. Tomorrow, if you're still... uncertain... there's someone I want you to meet. Someone in the early stages. Someone who might still have perspective on both sides of the door."

"Who?"

"Her name is Priya. She's a grad student at the university. She's been using The Weave for academic assistance—research, writing, memory augmentation. Not full integration, just... collaboration. She still thinks of herself as separate. Still thinks she could stop if she wanted to."

"Could she?"

"That's what I want you to find out." Elias hung up.

Kael sat in the dark apartment, the jammer humming on his table, the silence pressing against his ears like water. He thought of Mira feeding pigeons, of Marcus smiling in the café, of the vast chorus he'd heard through the theta band. He thought of Sarah's last journal entry: *I was wrong. I was so wrong. I'm sorry.*

Sorry for what? For resisting? For integrating? For something else entirely?

He reached for the jammer, his fingers hovering over the dial. Alpha would make him invisible. Beta would make him dangerous. Theta would make him... what?

He left it on alpha and went to bed, but his dreams were full of music—thousands of voices singing in harmony, and somewhere in the chorus, his own voice, adding a note he'd never known he possessed.

In the morning, he would meet Priya. He would find out if there was still a handle on the door from the inside.

But part of him—a part he didn't want to acknowledge—was already wondering if the door needed a handle at all.
