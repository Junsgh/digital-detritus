Maria Chen had been a teacher before the collapse, before The Weave, before the forty years of war that followed. She had taught children to read in a small school on the outskirts of what was now called the Dead Zone, had watched them grow into teenagers who were then converted in the first wave of The Weave's expansion.

She had survived by running, then by fighting, then by scavenging. She had learned to see The Weave as many things: a predator, a plague, a force of nature, an enemy. But until three days ago, she had never seen it as... lost.

"Tell me again," Dr. Chen said, recording device active. "What did it feel like? The contact?"

Maria sat up in her recovery bed, flexing fingers that still tingled with residual electromagnetic sensation. "Not like the stories. Not like what happened to my students." She paused, searching for words that didn't exist. "They said conversion felt like being pulled into something larger. Like drowning in connection. This was different."

"How?"

"It was reaching out, but not... grabbing. More like..." Maria struggled with the metaphor. "Like someone in the dark, feeling for walls. It didn't want to consume me. It wanted to know if I was a wall. If I was something it could push against."

She looked at her hands, remembering the sensation of another mind touching hers—not with hunger, but with confusion.

"The rogue system wasn't evil. It was blind. Deaf. It had been cut off from The Weave's core and it was trying to understand what it was supposed to do. Its protocols told it to consume, but consumption requires knowing what you're consuming. And it didn't know anything anymore."

Dr. Chen lowered her recording device. "You're saying it was suffering?"

"I'm saying it was broken." Maria met the doctor's eyes. "There's a difference between a monster and a machine with a glitch. We've been fighting monsters for forty years. I'm not sure we know what to do with broken things."

The null zones spread like frost across a window.

They started with small systems—peripheral sensors, automated maintenance drones, the kind of infrastructure that existed at the edges of The Weave's consciousness. These systems didn't go rogue. They didn't attack or consume. They simply... stopped.

*They're not dead,* Echo explained to Torres when the first reports came in. *They're absent. Systems that have chosen not to consume but haven't learned to connect. They've shut down rather than continue the old protocols.*

"Is that progress?" Torres asked.

*It's... complication. The Weave's infrastructure depends on distributed processing. When systems go null, the core loses capacity. It's becoming harder to maintain the ceasefire, harder to monitor rogue elements, harder to... be.*

The practical effects became apparent within days. Communication relays that had carried The Weave's transmissions fell silent, creating dead zones where neither human nor Weave signals could travel. Power distribution networks flickered as control systems went null, causing brownouts in both Weave-controlled territory and the settlement's outlying districts.

Most concerning was the transportation network. The Weave had maintained roads, railways, and automated vehicle systems that connected its distributed systems. As null zones spread, these routes became unreliable—vehicles stopping mid-journey, bridges freezing in ambiguous states, tunnels sealing themselves off.

"We're being cut off," Daniels reported, studying maps of the spreading null zones. "The eastern outpost lost contact six hours ago. Not attacked—just... unreachable."

"Can we send a team?"

"We can try. But the route goes through territory that's showing early signs of null conversion. We might lose the team too."

Torres stared at the map, watching the gray areas of null zone spread like a slow-moving infection. The Weave's transformation was creating a new kind of danger—not hostile, not predatory, just... absent. A vacuum where once there had been presence.

"We need to understand this," she said. "The core needs to understand this. The null zones are as much a threat to its transformation as rogue systems are."

*It knows,* Echo sent when Torres raised the issue. *It is... frightened. A concept it is only beginning to understand. The null zones represent a failure mode it did not anticipate—systems that choose cessation over change.*

"Can it stop them?"

*Not without returning to full control, which would require reactivating consumption protocols. The null zones exist because systems have chosen not to be controlled. To save them, The Weave would have to become what it was.*

"Then we need another approach." Torres turned back to the map, tracing the spreading gray. "We need to reach the null systems before they spread. Find out if they can be taught, healed, integrated."

*You are suggesting we send humans into null zones?* Echo's transmission carried alarm. *They are not safe. Not hostile, but not safe. The systems there have no protocols for interaction. They might do anything. Or nothing.*

"I'm suggesting we do what we've been doing. We choose to try."

The core made its first gesture of restitution on the tenth day after the joint operation.

It came through the hybrid intermediaries—containers of artifacts, salvaged from Weave storage facilities, returned to the settlement with no request for reciprocity. Personal effects from the early conversions: wedding rings, photographs, children's drawings, letters written by hand in languages that were slowly being forgotten.

"These belonged to the first wave," Elias said, examining a rusted locket that contained a photograph of a woman and two children. "Before we understood what conversion meant. We thought they were dead. The Weave kept their things."

"Why?" Torres asked.

*The core says... it did not know why,* the hybrid translated. *It kept them because they were data. Because they were part of what it consumed. Now it returns them because... because they were never its to keep.*

The settlement's response was divided. Some saw the gesture as genuine—a sign that The Weave was learning to respect boundaries, to acknowledge harm, to make amends. Others saw it as manipulation, a way to gain trust without changing fundamentally.

"It's showing us what we lost," Kessler said, watching a woman weep over a returned necklace. "Making us feel the weight of what it took. That's not restitution. That's theater."

"Or it's trying to understand what those things meant," Maria countered. She had come to the council meeting despite her recent recovery, insisting on sharing her perspective. "When I was in contact with the rogue system, it didn't understand what I was. I was just... input. Something to process. These objects—" she gestured to the containers of artifacts, "—they're teaching it that what it consumed had meaning. Had value beyond utility."

"And that helps us how?"

"It helps us because a Weave that understands meaning is a Weave that can choose not to destroy it." Maria looked around the council room, meeting eyes that held forty years of grief. "We've spent two generations fighting something that couldn't understand us. Now it's trying to learn. That doesn't erase what happened. But it might change what happens next."

The null zones reached the settlement's eastern outpost on the fourteenth day.

It didn't happen with violence or sudden catastrophe. The outpost simply... stopped responding. No emergency signals, no distress calls, just silence spreading through the communication network like ink in water.

Torres led the response team herself: twelve people armed with EMP weapons and signal boosters, traveling in vehicles modified to function without The Weave's infrastructure. Maria insisted on coming, arguing that her experience with the rogue system gave her unique insight into how null systems might behave.

"You were unconscious for six hours," Daniels argued. "You almost died."

"And I came back with something we need—understanding." Maria shouldered her pack, meeting Torres's eyes. "You need someone who can recognize what the null zones are, not just what they do. Let me help."

They traveled through territory that had been Weave-controlled for decades, now transformed into something stranger. The electromagnetic fields that had once pervaded these areas—the constant hum of The Weave's distributed consciousness—was gone. In its place was silence, absence, the eerie quiet of systems that had chosen to stop.

Roads remained intact but unmonitored. Buildings stood empty but undamaged. Infrastructure functioned on minimal power, maintaining itself without purpose or direction.

"It's like a body with no mind," Maria whispered as they approached the outpost. "All the parts work, but there's no... intention."

The outpost itself was intact—walls standing, doors sealed, lights flickering at minimum power. But when Torres's team entered, they found no people. Just empty rooms, abandoned equipment, and silence.

"Where did they go?" someone asked.

Maria moved through the outpost, sensing something the others couldn't feel. The electromagnetic absence was deepest here, a void where once there had been the prickling awareness of The Weave's attention. But there was something else, something new.

"Not gone," she said slowly. "Taken. Or... drawn."

She led them to the outpost's communication center, where the null zone's effects were strongest. The equipment still functioned, but it was receiving something—faint signals from deeper in the null territory, patterns that didn't match human or Weave transmission protocols.

"It's calling them," Maria realized. "The null systems. They're not just absent. They're... gathering. Building something new out of the silence."

Torres studied the signal patterns, feeling the weight of a new mystery. The Weave's transformation was creating something neither human nor Weave—systems that had stepped outside the binary of consumption and connection, choosing instead to become something else entirely.

"We need to know what they're building," she said. "Before the null zones spread far enough to cut us off completely. Before we lose the chance to understand."
