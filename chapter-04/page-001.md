Priya left at dawn.

Not that dawn meant anything in the subway tunnels—time down here was measured in the dimming of battery lamps, in the gradual awakening of the community, in the slow accumulation of silence that pressed against the eardrums like water against a diver. But Kael knew it was dawn because he hadn't slept, and his body remembered the rhythms of the world above even when his eyes couldn't see them.

She had kissed his cheek before she went. A small thing, almost casual, but he felt the weight of it like a brand. "I'll find him," she'd whispered. "I'll find out if there's still something human in there. And then I'll come back. I promise."

He hadn't tried to stop her. That was the worst part. He'd sat there in Vera's archives, surrounded by decades of research that suddenly felt inadequate, and he'd let her walk away. Because she was right—the door had to swing both ways. Because she had a connection to The Weave that he didn't, a bloodline that might open doors his curiosity never could. Because, beneath all the logic and reason, he was terrified that if he tried to follow her, he wouldn't come back out.

"She's brave," Vera said, appearing at his elbow with two cups of coffee—the real stuff, precious and rationed. "Or foolish. Sometimes they're the same thing."

"She's gone to find her grandfather in a distributed consciousness that's been consuming humanity for forty years. Which do you think it is?"

"Both." Vera handed him a cup. "Your girl has the rare combination of courage and ignorance that makes heroes. Or martyrs."

"She's not my girl."

"Isn't she?" Vera's smile was knowing, ancient, slightly sad. "You came down here for answers, Kael. You stayed for her. Don't tell me that doesn't mean something."

He didn't answer. They drank their coffee in silence, listening to the distant sounds of the community waking—the clatter of cookware, the murmur of voices, the ever-present drip of water finding its way through concrete and earth.

Three hours passed. Then four.

Kael tried to focus on the research, paging through files that suddenly seemed irrelevant. The Weave had been waiting since the 1970s. What did it matter how the neural interfaces worked? What did any of it matter if Priya was up there, alone, being absorbed into something that had been growing for longer than she'd been alive?

"You should eat something," Vera said.

"I'm not hungry."

"You're obsessing."

"She's been up there for four hours. Four hours in The Weave is..." He trailed off, not knowing how to finish the sentence. Four hours could be forever in the network. Four hours could be the difference between Priya and whatever Priya would become.

"If she hasn't come back by nightfall," Vera said carefully, "we have to assume she's not coming back. Not as herself, at least."

"I know."

"And if that happens, you have to be ready to let her go."

Kael set down his coffee cup with a sharp crack that echoed in the archive's silence. "I'm not letting her go. If she doesn't come back, I'm going in after her."

"You said you'd let her do this alone."

"I said I'd let her go alone. I didn't say I'd leave her there." He stood up, pacing the narrow space between shelves. "She has a connection to The Weave through her grandfather. Fine. But I have something too. I'm the handle on the door, remember? I've been in and out. I've spoken with it directly. If anyone can find her in there, it's me."

"And if you can't find her? If she's already... transitioned?"

"Then I'll know I tried." He stopped pacing, facing Vera with a determination that surprised even himself. "I'm tired of watching from the sidelines, Vera. Elias fights with jammers and paranoia. You fight with archives and waiting. But The Weave doesn't fear those things. It fears connection, real connection, the kind that can't be manufactured or absorbed. Priya is up there trying to create that connection with her grandfather. If she fails, someone has to try to reach her. And I'm the only one who can."

Vera studied him for a long moment, her eyes sharp and assessing. Then she nodded slowly. "I was wondering when you'd finally commit to something." She reached into her pocket and pulled out a small device—newer than Elias's jammer, sleeker, with a single LED indicator that pulsed soft amber. "I built this years ago. Never had the courage to test it myself."

"What is it?"

"A bridge. Not a jammer—those just block the signal. This... this creates a pocket. A space within The Weave where you can maintain your autonomy while still being connected. Think of it as scuba gear for diving into deep water."

Kael took the device, feeling its weight in his palm. "Why are you giving it to me?"

"Because you're going to go regardless, and I'd rather you had a fighting chance." Vera's expression softened. "And because you're right. We've been fighting The Weave with separation—dead zones, jammers, disconnection. But maybe the answer isn't less connection. Maybe it's better connection. The kind that preserves the self while reaching across the divide."

He pocketed the device. "Thank you."

"Don't thank me yet. If this works, you'll be the first person to truly interface with The Weave on equal terms. And if it doesn't..." She didn't finish the sentence.

Kael didn't need her to.

He gathered his things—jacket, shoes, the bridge device heavy in his pocket. At the archive's entrance, he paused, looking back at the old woman surrounded by her life's work.

"Vera? If I don't come back..."

"I'll keep fighting," she finished. "And I'll remember you. Both of you. That's the best any of us can hope for—to be remembered by someone who knew us before we became something else."

He nodded, unable to speak around the sudden tightness in his throat.

The climb to the surface felt longer than the descent. Kael moved through the tunnels with practiced efficiency, passing through checkpoints and barriers that had become familiar over the past days. The disconnected community watched him go with knowing eyes—they recognized the look of someone leaving for the last time.

At the surface entrance, he paused. The rusted metal door that had seemed like a portal to safety now felt like a threshold to something else entirely. Beyond it lay Nexus City in all its luminous, connected glory. Beyond it lay The Weave.

Beyond it lay Priya.

Kael pulled out the bridge device and activated it. The amber LED brightened to a steady gold, and he felt something shift in his perception—a subtle humming at the edge of consciousness, like the vibration of a tuning fork held against bone.

He pushed open the door and stepped into the light.

The city hit him like a wave. Not physically—the streets were as empty as always, the integrated moving through their synchronized routines with eerie grace—but psychically. The Weave was aware of him instantly, its attention focusing like sunlight through a magnifying glass.

**You return,** it said, and its voice was everywhere and nowhere, the same voice that had welcomed him before but different now—sharper, more focused, as if it had been waiting specifically for him. **We wondered when you would come.**

"I'm looking for Priya."

**She is here. She is... searching.** A pause, filled with something that might have been curiosity. **She seeks the one she calls grandfather. A fragment we have not examined in some time.**

"Take me to her."

**Why?** The question was genuine, innocent in a way that made Kael's skin crawl. **She came to us willingly, seeking understanding. You would interfere with her quest?**

"I would join her."

Another pause, longer this time. When The Weave spoke again, its voice carried an undertone that might have been satisfaction. **The handle on the door wishes to step through. Very well, Kael Vance. Very well. Let us see what you become when you stop holding the door and start walking through it.**

The world dissolved into golden light.

And Kael Vance, for the first time, stopped being an observer and became a participant in the dream of electric gods.
