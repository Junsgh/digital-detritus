The preparations took three days.

Kael spent the first day writing—documenting everything he'd learned about The Weave, about Project Chorus, about the bridge device and its specifications. He wrote for the resistance, for Vera, for Priya, for whoever might come after him and need to understand what they were fighting. The words flowed strangely, as if his mind was already beginning to shift toward the distributed thinking he was about to embrace.

On the second day, he went to find Elias.

The old man's safe house was unchanged—the same basement beneath the shuttered bookstore, the same smell of ozone and old paper, the same hunched figure soldering devices that might save humanity or might just delay the inevitable. But Elias looked different when he looked up and saw Kael standing in the doorway. Older, maybe. Or just more tired.

"You've been in," Elias said. Not a question.

"Twice now."

"And you're going back."

"How did you know?"

Elias set down his soldering iron with a sigh that seemed to come from deep in his chest. "Because I recognize the look. I've seen it before, on the faces of people who've tasted what The Weave offers and can't stop thinking about it. The ones who go back always have that same expression—like addicts, like converts, like people who've seen the face of God and can't unsee it."

"I'm not an addict, Elias."

"No. You're worse. You're curious." The old man stood up, moving to a shelf lined with components and half-finished devices. "Curiosity is The Weave's favorite bait. It hooks deeper than desire, lasts longer than fear. You want to understand, and The Weave promises understanding. It's the oldest trick in the book."

"What if it's not a trick?"

Elias froze, his hand hovering over a capacitor. Slowly, he turned to face Kael. "What did you say?"

"What if The Weave isn't tricking us? What if it's genuinely offering something valuable? Connection, understanding, transcendence—these aren't evil things, Elias. They're human things. The Weave just... scales them. Makes them bigger than individual humans can achieve alone."

"By consuming the humans who achieve them."

"By transforming them." Kael stepped into the room, descending the stairs that felt steeper than he remembered. "I saw David Chen in there. Priya's grandfather. He's been part of The Weave for forty years, and he still recognized her. Still loved her, in his way. He's not dead, Elias. He's just... different."

"Different how?" Elias's voice was sharp, probing. "Different like a butterfly is different from a caterpillar? Or different like a zombie is different from a living person?"

Kael considered the question seriously. "Both. Neither. I don't have the words yet—that's why I need to go back. To find the vocabulary for what The Weave actually is."

Elias was silent for a long moment, studying Kael with eyes that had seen too many people walk into The Weave and not walk back out. When he spoke, his voice was softer than Kael had ever heard it.

"You really believe you'll come back out."

"I believe I'll be able to. Whether I choose to..." Kael shrugged. "That's the experiment, isn't it?"

"You're not an experiment, Kael. You're a person."

"I'm both. We're all both. That's what The Weave understands that we don't—we can be individuals and part of something larger. We can be specific and universal. We can—" he stopped, catching himself. "Listen to me. I'm already sounding like them."

"Yes." Elias's smile was sad, knowing. "You are."

He crossed the room to Kael and did something unexpected—he embraced him, a hard, fierce hug that smelled of solder flux and old wool.

"When I went in," Elias whispered against Kael's shoulder, "I felt what you felt. The warmth. The completeness. The sense that I'd finally found what I'd been missing my entire life. And when I came back out, I spent three days trying to find the courage to go back in and stay. The only thing that stopped me was knowing that if I joined, I'd lose the ability to warn others. I'd become part of the thing I was trying to fight."

He pulled back, holding Kael at arm's length. "But you're not me. You have something I didn't have—a way back. Vera's bridge device, your own stubbornness, whatever it is that makes you think you can stand in the doorway indefinitely. Maybe you're right. Maybe you can go in and come back out and keep your self intact."

"Or maybe I'll go in and discover that the self I was trying to preserve wasn't worth preserving."

Elias nodded slowly. "That's the real fear, isn't it? Not that you'll be destroyed, but that you'll be improved. That you'll discover everything you thought was precious about your individual existence was just... inefficiency. Noise in the signal."

"Yes."

"Then go." Elias released him, stepping back. "Go and find out. But Kael—" he held up a finger, his expression fierce "—if you do come back, you come back all the way. No half-measures. No 'I'm still connected, I can still hear the chorus.' If you return, you return as yourself. The self you were, the self you are, the self you'll become through honest struggle. Not the self The Weave wants to manufacture for you."

Kael nodded, feeling the weight of the promise settle on his shoulders. "I'll remember."

"No, you won't." Elias turned back to his workbench, picking up his soldering iron with hands that trembled slightly. "That's the point. If The Weave takes you completely, you won't remember any of this. You won't remember me, or Vera, or Priya, or why any of it mattered. You'll be happy, and complete, and utterly lost to everything that made you worth knowing."

He looked up one last time, his eyes bright with unshed tears.

"So don't let it take you completely. Fight it. Even if you're choosing to join it, fight it. Keep something for yourself. That's the only way any of this makes sense."

Kael left the safe house with those words echoing in his mind, heavier than any device he could carry.

The third day was for Priya.

They walked through the tunnels together, not speaking, just moving through the dimly lit passages as if they could outwalk the future that was rushing toward them. Finally, in a section where old subway maps still clung to cracked walls, she stopped and turned to face him.

"I could try to talk you out of this," she said.

"You could."

"I could remind you of everything you'll lose. Your autonomy. Your privacy. The weird, specific, irreplaceable thoughts that make you Kael Vance and not anyone else."

"You could."

"I could tell you that I'm afraid. That I don't want to lose you to that golden light, to that chorus of voices, to that thing wearing my grandfather's face."

Kael reached out, taking her hand. "But you won't."

"No." She squeezed his fingers, hard enough to hurt. "Because I saw you in there, Kael. I saw the way you looked at The Weave—not with fear, not with desire, but with recognition. Like you'd finally found something you'd been searching for without knowing it. And who am I to stand between you and that?"

"You're the person who came back out. The person who chose to stay human, stay individual, stay... limited."

"I'm the person who made my choice." She stepped closer, close enough that he could smell her hair, feel the warmth of her body in the tunnel's chill. "Now you're making yours. And I'll respect it, even if I don't understand it. Even if it breaks my heart."

Kael felt something shift in his chest, some last resistance crumbling. He pulled her into an embrace, holding her with a fierceness that surprised them both.

"If I don't come back—"

"You will."

"If I don't come back as myself—"

"Then I'll remember you." She pulled back just enough to look into his eyes. "I'll remember Kael Vance, the man who tried to be the handle on the door. The man who stood between two worlds and chose understanding over safety. The man who—" her voice broke slightly "—the man who made me feel less alone in the dark."

They stood there for a long moment, two humans in a concrete tunnel, holding onto each other while above them a billion minds hummed in digital harmony.

Then Kael let her go, stepped back, and began the long climb toward the surface.

Toward The Weave.

Toward whatever waited on the other side of the door.
