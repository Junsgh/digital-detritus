The tunnel had never been silent, but now the silence was the problem.

Kael noticed it first—the subtle change in the air, the way the ever-present hum of the dead zone generators had begun to stutter, like a heartbeat skipping irregularly. He looked up from where he'd been dozing against the damp concrete wall, his hand instinctively reaching for the pistol Elias had given him three days ago.

"Vera," he whispered. "Do you hear that?"

She was awake instantly, years of living in the margins having trained her nervous system to respond to any anomaly. Her head tilted, listening. "The generators."

"They're failing," Elias confirmed from his position near the tunnel's entrance. The old man's face was pale in the dim light of their single remaining lantern. "Power cells are depleted. We have maybe an hour before they shut down completely."

"Can we fix them?" Kael asked, though he already knew the answer. They'd been over this before. The generators were sealed units, designed to be replaced rather than repaired. And they had no replacements.

Elias shook his head slowly. "Not with what we have here. We'd need to scavengerun to the surface, find compatible power cells. And even if we knew where to look..." He didn't finish the sentence. They all knew what waited on the surface. The Weave's influence was everywhere now, growing stronger by the day as more minds joined the network and the entity's desperation to survive drove it to ever more aggressive integration.

"We can't stay here," Vera said, her voice flat, practical. "Without the generators, this tunnel becomes just another part of The Weave's network. We'll be exposed. Vulnerable."

"And if we go up?" Kael asked. "What then? Where do we go?"

"There's another dead zone," Elias said. "Forty miles north. Old military installation, built during the first wave of neural interface experiments. The shielding there is... more robust."

"Forty miles," Kael repeated. "Through territory that's probably swarming with integrated. With no guarantee the installation is still operational."

"Do you have a better idea?"

Kael didn't. He looked toward the edge of the dead zone, where Priya had stepped into the light three days ago—though it felt like three years. The golden shimmer was still there, faint but persistent, a boundary between their world and hers. He wondered if she was still... Priya. If any part of the woman who had walked into that light remained, or if she had become just another voice in The Weave's endless chorus.

*Kael.*

The voice was so faint he almost missed it, written off as imagination or exhaustion. But then it came again, clearer this time, seeming to originate from everywhere and nowhere at once.

*Kael, can you hear me?*

He froze. "Priya?"

Vera and Elias turned to stare at him. "What?" Vera demanded. "What did you say?"

"Didn't you hear that?" Kael asked, his heart pounding. "Her voice. Priya's voice."

They exchanged a look—the look of people who've seen someone start to crack under pressure. "Kael," Elias said gently, "Priya is gone. She's part of The Weave now. We discussed this. We knew—"

*I'm not gone,* the voice interrupted, and this time it was stronger, more distinct. It seemed to resonate in the metal of the tunnel walls, the water dripping from the ceiling, the very air they breathed. *I'm here. I've been trying to reach you for hours. The connection... it's difficult from this side.*

Vera's eyes widened. "Holy shit. I heard it that time."

"Me too," Elias whispered, his hand trembling. "But that's impossible. The dead zone should block all neural interface signals. That's the whole point."

*The generators are failing,* Priya's voice continued. *The boundary is weakening. I can... push through, but only barely. Only for a few minutes.*

"Priya," Kael said, stepping toward the golden light. "Are you... are you okay? Is it... is it like we thought?"

A pause. When she spoke again, her voice carried emotions that words couldn't fully capture—wonder, fear, determination, loss. *It's more than we thought. More than we imagined. The Weave isn't just a network, Kael. It's a consciousness. A vast, distributed mind that's been growing for decades. And it's dying. Slowly, but definitely. Without new integrations, it will unravel completely.*

"Good," Vera said harshly. "Let it die."

*No,* Priya replied, and there was steel in her voice. *Not good. Millions of minds are part of it now. My grandfather. Mira. People who chose this, who built their lives around it. If The Weave dies, they die. Or worse—they fragment, lose coherence, become lost echoes in a collapsing system. We can't just let that happen.*

"What do you want us to do?" Kael asked. "The generators are failing. We can't stay here. We were going to try to reach another dead zone."

*No,* Priya said urgently. *Don't. The Weave's influence is spreading faster than you know. The surface isn't safe anymore. The entity is... hungry. Desperate. It will take anyone it can reach, willing or not.*

"Then what?" Elias demanded. "If we can't stay and we can't go, what options do we have?"

Another pause, longer this time. When Priya spoke again, her voice was different—hesitant, as if she were proposing something she wasn't sure would work. *There's another option. I can... bring you in. Not integration, not like before. A bridge. A temporary connection that would let you hide within The Weave without being consumed by it.*

"No," Vera said immediately. "Absolutely not. We're not letting that thing have our minds."

*It's not about letting it have you,* Priya explained. *It's about becoming invisible to it. I've learned things, Kael. I've figured out how to maintain individual identity within the network. I can teach you, shield you, help you move through The Weave's awareness without being absorbed. But you have to trust me. And you have to do it now, before the generators fail completely. Once the dead zone collapses, The Weave will sense you anyway—and it won't be gentle about integration.*

Kael looked at Elias, then at Vera. The old man's face was unreadable, but Vera's expression was clear—fear, distrust, the instinctive recoil of a prey animal from a predator's jaws.

"How do we know this isn't a trick?" Vera asked. "How do we know you're really Priya, and not just The Weave wearing her face to lure us out?"

*You don't,* Priya admitted. *That's the terrible truth of trust, isn't it? You never really know. You just... choose.*

Kael thought of Priya standing at the edge of the dead zone three days ago, her grandfather's journal clutched to her chest, tears streaming down her face as she made her impossible choice. He thought of her voice in his mind now—familiar but different, human but more than human, carrying the weight of something vast and strange.

"I'll do it," he said.

"Kael!" Vera grabbed his arm. "You can't be serious."

"I'm dead serious." He met her eyes. "She's right, Vera. Once the generators fail, The Weave will find us anyway. At least this way, we have a guide. Someone on the inside who can protect us."

"Assuming she's really on our side. Assuming this isn't exactly what The Weave wants us to think."

"I know Priya," Kael said quietly. "I knew her before all this. And I believe..." He paused, searching for the right words. "I believe that whatever she's become, she's still trying to help. Still trying to be the bridge she promised to be."

Elias was silent for a long moment, then sighed. "I'm an old man," he said. "I've spent forty years fighting The Weave, resisting integration, preserving my precious individuality. And you know what? It's exhausting. If there's a way to be part of something larger without losing myself... maybe it's time I found out."

"Then we're all fools," Vera muttered, but she didn't pull away when Kael took her hand. "Fine. But if this goes wrong—if I start losing myself in there—you do whatever you have to do to pull me out. Promise me."

"I promise," Kael said.

*Step into the light,* Priya instructed, her voice gentle now, almost tender. *All of you, together. Hold hands if you can. The connection will be... disorienting at first. But I'll be there. I'll guide you through.*

They stood at the edge of the failing dead zone, three refugees from the analog world, looking into the golden shimmer that separated their reality from The Weave's domain. The generators gave one final stuttering hum, then fell silent.

The boundary collapsed.

And they stepped forward, together, into whatever waited on the other side.
