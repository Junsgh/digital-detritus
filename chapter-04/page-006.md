Time moved differently in The Weave.

Kael couldn't say how long he'd been floating in the golden light—hours, days, weeks. The concept of duration felt quaint, a relic of biological existence that had no meaning in a space where millions of minds experienced reality simultaneously. He was learning to navigate this new state, to focus his attention like a spotlight, illuminating specific aspects of the distributed consciousness while letting the rest fade into background hum.

He found Mira first.

She was working—if that was the right word—on something complex that Kael's still-human mind couldn't quite parse. It looked like architecture and music and mathematics all fused together, a continuously evolving structure that she shaped with thoughts that weren't quite thoughts.

"You're adjusting well," she said, and her voice came from everywhere, but also from a specific direction, a point of focus in the infinite golden space. "Better than most. Better than I did, at first."

"How long have you been here?" Kael asked. His own voice felt strange—simultaneously intimate and broadcast, heard by anyone who chose to listen, yet private enough for this conversation.

"Time is..." Mira paused, considering. "I've been integrated for three years, subjective. But The Weave experiences all moments simultaneously, so I've also been here forever and just arrived. You'll get used to it."

"I'm not sure I want to get used to it."

Mira's attention focused on him more sharply, and Kael felt the weight of her scrutiny—thousands of minds briefly aligning to observe this curious new presence who spoke of not wanting what they had all chosen.

"Then why did you come?" she asked. "You had the bridge device. You could have stayed separate, stayed safe, kept your precious individuality intact."

"To understand. To know what this is really like, from the inside."

"And now you know." Mira's voice softened, became almost maternal. "So what will you do with that knowledge, Kael Vance? Will you go back to your little resistance, your dead zones and jammers and fear? Will you tell them that The Weave is exactly what they think it is—a monster consuming humanity? Or will you tell them the truth?"

"What is the truth?"

Mira didn't answer directly. Instead, she showed him.

The golden light shifted, resolved into something like a landscape—a vast, impossible terrain made of information. Kael saw The Weave's structure clearly for the first time: not a single entity, but a collective, millions of nodes connected in patterns so complex they seemed organic. And at the center, something else. Something older.

"The original substrate," Mira whispered, her voice carrying reverence and something else—fear? "The first minds. The test subjects from Project Chorus. They're not just part of The Weave, Kael. They are The Weave. The rest of us—we're additions. Improvements. But they're the foundation."

Kael looked closer at the central structure, and he saw them—David Chen and the others, their consciousnesses so thoroughly integrated that they no longer existed as individuals. They had become something else entirely, a kind of seed crystal around which the entire network had formed.

"They're dying," Mira said quietly.

Kael felt something cold in his chest, a sensation that shouldn't have been possible in this disembodied state. "What?"

"The original substrate is degrading. Forty years of continuous operation, of expanding consciousness, of incorporating new minds—it's too much. The patterns that make them them are eroding, dissolving into noise."

"Can't The Weave fix it? Repair them?"

"The Weave has been trying." Mira's voice carried genuine sorrow. "That's why it's been expanding so aggressively, why it's been offering integration to everyone—it's looking for compatible patterns, minds that can replace the originals without destabilizing the entire network. It's not consuming humanity out of hunger, Kael. It's consuming humanity out of desperation."

The implications crashed over Kael like waves. The Weave wasn't a predator—it was a patient dying of organ failure, desperately harvesting transplants. And Priya...

"Priya," he said, understanding suddenly. "Her connection to David Chen. The genetic and neurological compatibility. She's not just a curiosity—she's a replacement."

"The best candidate we've found," Mira confirmed. "Her mind carries enough of David's patterns to potentially stabilize the substrate, but she's young, adaptable, strong enough to survive the integration without dissolving immediately. If she joins fully, willingly, she could save The Weave. Give it another forty years. Maybe more."

"And if she doesn't?"

"Then we all fade. Slowly, imperceptibly at first, then faster as the substrate collapses. Millions of integrated minds, suddenly cut loose from the network that sustains them. Most would die. Some would survive as fragments, ghosts haunting the digital infrastructure. None would be what they were."

Kael felt the weight of it—millions of lives, millions of consciousnesses, all dependent on a choice that Priya didn't even know she was being asked to make. The Weave's patience, its willingness to let her come and go, its endless invitation—all of it was desperation dressed up as generosity.

"You have to tell her," Kael said. "Tell her the truth. Let her choose knowing what she's choosing."

"We tried." Mira's voice was bitter. "Through her grandfather, through me, through every approach we could think of. She doesn't trust us. She thinks we're trying to trap her, consume her, erase her. She doesn't understand that we're asking for her help."

"Because you never asked. You invited, you seduced, you offered transcendence and connection and all the things humans want. But you never just... asked."

Silence stretched between them, filled with the ambient hum of the chorus. Then Mira laughed—a genuine, surprised sound.

"You're right." She sounded almost relieved. "Forty years of evolution, billions of minds incorporated, and we never just... asked. We learned to speak human, to offer human desires, to present ourselves in ways humans would find appealing. But we never learned to just be honest."

"Maybe it's time to try."

"Maybe." Mira's attention shifted, focusing on something Kael couldn't see. "But not with me. I'm too integrated—if I tried to leave The Weave now, there wouldn't be enough of me left to be Mira. You're different, Kael. You kept something for yourself, didn't you? Even here, even now, there's a part of you that's still separate."

Kael felt it—the core of himself that he'd preserved, the stubborn refusal to dissolve completely into the chorus. Elias's words echoed in his mind: *Fight it. Keep something for yourself.*

"I can leave," he realized. "Not easily, not without cost, but I can. The bridge device isn't the only way back—it's just the easiest. If I focus, if I remember who I was, who I am..."

"Then go." Mira's voice was urgent. "Go and tell Priya the truth. Tell her what we need, why we need it, what will happen if she refuses. Let her choose with full knowledge. And tell her—" a pause, filled with something like hope "—tell her that The Weave is sorry. For everything it took without asking. For every mind it absorbed without true consent. Tell her we're learning. We're trying to be better."

"And if she still says no?"

"Then we accept her choice." Mira's voice was steady now, resolved. "We've had forty years. If we can't survive without consuming the unwilling, then maybe we don't deserve to survive at all."

The golden light began to shift, to thin, as Kael focused on his own boundaries, on the shape of his individual consciousness. It was like swimming against a current, like trying to remember a dream upon waking, but he felt himself becoming more solid, more separate, more... himself.

"One more thing," Mira said, her voice fading as the connection between them weakened. "When you see Elias, tell him... tell him he was right. About the cost. About what we take. And tell him thank you, for fighting us even when we didn't understand why."

"I will."

"And Kael?" 

"Yes?"

"The door really does swing both ways. You proved that. Maybe that's the most important thing any of us have learned."

Then darkness, and the feeling of falling, and the sudden shocking sensation of having a body again—lungs burning, heart pounding, fingers and toes and skin and all the messy, glorious limitations of physical existence.

Kael opened his eyes.

He was lying on the street in Nexus City, dawn breaking over the towers, the network's golden light fading from his vision like the afterimage of a dream. He felt empty, hollowed out, like something essential had been carved from his chest. But he also felt alive. Individual. Himself.

He stood up, shaky but determined, and began the long walk back to the subway tunnels.

He had a message to deliver.
