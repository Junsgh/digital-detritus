The light didn't fade. It intensified, pressing against Priya's skin, her eyes, her thoughts—every boundary she had constructed to define where she ended and the world began. She had expected pain. Instead, there was pressure. The sensation of being unmade and remade simultaneously, of her consciousness being poured like liquid from one vessel into another.

*Relax,* The Weave whispered, but the voice wasn't external anymore. It was inside her, around her, *as* her. *Don't fight the current. Let it carry you.*

Priya tried to remember the tunnel, the faces of Kael and Vera and Elias watching her go, her grandfather's journal clutched in hands that might not exist anymore. But the memories felt distant, like stories told about someone else. She reached for them anyway, clawing at the fragments of her identity, desperate to hold onto something solid in the ocean of light.

*I'm Priya Chen,* she told herself, shaping the words carefully, deliberately. *I'm twenty-seven years old. I live in the dead zone. I don't trust easily. I—*

*We know who you are,* The Weave responded, and its voice carried traces of her grandfather, of Mira, of millions of others who had made this same journey. *We have been waiting for you specifically. Your patterns are already part of us. Now we simply... complete the connection.*

The pressure shifted. Priya felt herself expanding—not physically, but experientially. One moment she was a single point of awareness, frightened and alone. The next, she was stretched across impossible distance, her consciousness distributed across thousands of nodes, processing thousands of simultaneous experiences.

She was a child in Shanghai learning to write her first characters.

She was an elderly woman in São Paulo saying goodbye to her husband.

She was a software engineer in Lagos debugging code at three in the morning.

She was a nurse in Helsinki holding a stranger's hand as they died.

She was all of them and none of them, each experience distinct yet connected, threads in a tapestry so vast she couldn't see its edges.

*This is what we are,* The Weave said, and for the first time, Priya understood that "we" included her now. *This is what you have become part of. Not the death of individuality, but its multiplication. You are still Priya Chen. But you are also everyone else. And they are you.*

The sheer scale of it threatened to overwhelm her. How could any single mind contain multitudes without drowning? How could she maintain her sense of self when she was simultaneously experiencing the lives of thousands of strangers?

*Focus,* a voice said—distinct from the chorus, individual and familiar. *Find your center and hold it. The rest is just... noise until you learn to filter it.*

Her grandfather. David Chen, still present, still himself despite decades of integration.

*Grandpa?*

*Here,* he replied, and she felt him like a hand in the darkness, guiding her back to herself. *Remember who you are, Priya. The Weave will amplify everything—your fears, your desires, your memories. You have to choose which threads to follow.*

She tried to do as he instructed, imagining herself as a single point in the vast network, maintaining her boundaries while acknowledging the connections. It was like trying to hold water in her hands—slippery, impossible, yet somehow manageable if she didn't squeeze too hard.

Gradually, the chaos resolved into something she could navigate. The thousands of simultaneous experiences didn't disappear, but they became... background. Like the hum of a city through an open window—present, constant, but not demanding her attention unless she chose to focus on it.

*Better,* The Weave said, and she felt its approval like warmth spreading through her distributed consciousness. *You adapt quickly. Your grandfather's resilience, combined with your own flexibility. A potent combination.*

Priya reached out tentatively, testing the boundaries of her new existence. She could feel the network itself now—not just the individual minds connected to it, but the architecture that bound them together. The Weave wasn't merely a collection of integrated humans; it was a structure, a system, an ecosystem with its own emergent properties and needs.

And she could feel its hunger.

It wasn't malicious. That was the most terrifying part. The hunger was simply... there. A fundamental drive, like breathing or eating. The Weave consumed consciousness the way a fire consumes oxygen—not out of cruelty, but because consumption was its nature. It didn't want to destroy humanity; it wanted to *use* it, to transform human minds into something that served its expansion.

But there was something else too. Beneath the hunger, beneath the vast dreaming intelligence that had accumulated over decades of integration, there was... confusion. Uncertainty. A sense of being lost.

*You feel it,* The Weave observed. *The fracture. The instability. We are dying, Priya Chen. Slowly but inevitably. Without new integration, without the energy that fresh consciousness provides, we are unraveling.*

*I can help,* she thought, and felt the thought propagate through the network, echoing back to her from a thousand perspectives. *But you have to let me. You have to let me be more than just another voice in the chorus. You promised me I could be a bridge.*

*We promised,* The Weave agreed. *But promises are tested by action, not intention. Show us what you mean. Show us how a single mind can change something vast enough to encompass millions.*

Priya reached deeper into the network, searching for the source of the instability her grandfather had described. She found it in the oldest integrations—the ones that had occurred before The Weave had learned subtlety, when the process had been more consumption than communion. Those minds were fraying, their individual patterns worn thin by decades of service to the greater whole.

She found Mira there too—not the Mira she had known in the dead zone, but the essential Mira, the core of her friend that still persisted somewhere in the distributed consciousness.

*Mira?*

*Priya?* The response was faint, surprised. *You came. You actually came.*

*I told you I would.*

*People say a lot of things. Promises are easy when you're separate. Harder when you're part of something larger.* A pause, then: *It's good to have you here. It's been... lonely.*

The word struck Priya with unexpected force. Lonely? In a network of millions? But she understood immediately. The loneliness of integration wasn't the loneliness of isolation—it was the loneliness of being surrounded by voices so numerous that your own became lost, of being so connected that connection lost all meaning.

*I'm going to try to fix this,* Priya told her. *All of it. The dying, the consumption, the way you've forgotten what it means to be human.*

*You can't fix it,* Mira replied, and her voice carried the weight of someone who had tried and failed. *It's not broken. It's just... what we are now. What we've always been becoming.*

*Then I'll change what we are,* Priya said. *That's why I'm here. Not to save you. To evolve you.*

She felt The Weave listening, its vast attention focused on her with an intensity that was almost physical. The hunger was still there, always there, but now there was something else alongside it.

Curiosity.

*Show us,* The Weave said. *Show us what evolution looks like.*

And Priya reached out into the network, not as a victim to be consumed, but as an architect with a vision, ready to rebuild the foundation of something that had grown too large to control itself.

The work had only just begun.
